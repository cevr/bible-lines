In temporal matters there is a great variety of ways of management, and yet none of these variations in manner of labor, in exercise of gifts, need to create dissension and discord and disunion. One man may be conversant with the Scriptures, and some particular portion of the Scripture is especially appreciated by him because he has seen it in a certain striking light; another sees another portion as very important; and thus one and another presents the very points to the people that appear of highest value. This is all in the order of God. One man blunders in his interpretation of some portion of the Scripture, but shall this cause diversity and disunion? God forbid.

He saw that the lack must be supplied and he moved strongly and the burden was not equally divided. Brethren G, W, L, and J should not have been so backward, but should have shared the burdens at the very time they ought to be borne. Brother M became impatient and his brethren were grieved with him, but their error was greater than his.

Whenever your ideas are crossed, however perverted, then you lose that self-control so elevated and noble in the Christian character; you become untamable, unreasonable. Your self-love and independence become so strong [that] there is not one in your house or in connection with you who does not feel your presence and arbitrary power that will permit no liberty of conscience. By this course you alienate your brethren and even your own kindred from you. You force them to take a position at variance with you, and then you feel that they abuse you. Your own course pursued brought around these results. Your brethren saw these defects, that should you carry out your mind the results would be disastrous to the cause of God."},{"refcode_short":"15MR 367.2","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 15 [Nos. 1136-1185], p. 367.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Now, consider how many times Jesus has forgiven you and taken His willful and rebellious child back to His arms. He has pitied and forgiven you the heavy debt you owed to Him, and yet notwithstanding this amazing love exercised toward you, you go forth like a debtor presented in the Scriptures whom God forgave an enormous debt but who found one of his fellow servants which owed him a few pence and he laid hands on him and “took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest, and thrust him into prison till he should pay the debt.”"},{"refcode_short":"15MR 368.1","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 15 [Nos. 1136-1185], p. 368.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"For you to pursue a course similar to this, Daniel, is poor policy. God in mercy has forgiven you great sins, and your brethren, whom you grieve and afflict with your wrong, who have studied and planned how to help you—if their decisions and plans injured your dignity, you have held them to strict account. You will relate your grievances while you have no just sense of your own wrongs which led to the necessity of the action of your brethren in your case. Unless you are a thoroughly converted man before you leave this house, I believe the Spirit of God will never make another appeal to you. It is life or death with you. You will surely be stricken down with paralysis, or the devil will drive you to suicide. I have, in the message hitherto borne to you, tried to establish you in the confidence of your brethren. [I have tried] to strengthen and settle you; but if you leave this house with the devil as your counselor, you are a lost man."},{"refcode_short":"15MR 368.2","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 15 [Nos. 1136-1185], p. 368.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I have not in this message any comfort to give to Satan. The arrows of the Almighty must wound you so sorely that you will feel that you need a physician. “I have torn,” saith God, “and I will heal; I have smitten and I will bind you up.” When you come, meek and lowly, then Jesus will pardon your transgressions.

He prayed for himself rather faintly. I prayed again and again, with strong crying and tears, for God to cast out the devil. Brother A. C. and Marian, his [D.T.’s] wife, prayed with great brokenness of spirit. A terrible struggle was going on with Daniel. He did not fully surrender, but his face looked as though soul and body were rent asunder. He made concessions but had not yet yielded."},{"refcode_short":"15MR 369.1","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 15 [Nos. 1136-1185], p. 369.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"September 25—In the evening we had a ministers’ meeting. I had feared that Daniel would not be present, but he came into the meeting. I opened the meeting with prayer. The spirit of earnest intercession was upon me, and the power of God was in our midst. Daniel prayed after me; he began to break and confess. We had a remarkable meeting. All prayed with weeping and humiliation of soul and hearty confessions."},{"refcode_short":"15MR 369.2","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 15 [Nos. 1136-1185], p. 369.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I told them all that the object of our assembly together was to seek the Lord. I told them I was alarmed that at this late stage of the meeting, being Friday, that Satan was developing his power; he was stronger than they. We must have more than human help; we must seek God unitedly, and with strong faith claim His grace and strength to help us just now."},{"refcode_short":"15MR 369.3","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 15 [Nos. 1136-1185], p. 369.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Brother Vuilleumier offered a most earnest prayer. I could not understand a word of it, since it was in French, but the Spirit of the Lord pervaded the meeting. Brother Matteson's prayer was full of the Spirit. All seemed to humble themselves before God. Brother Andrews began to feel and confess his coolness and to plead with God for help. Brother Wilcox began to throw his heart into the work. The council had advised his stay another year in England. This seemed to take life and soul out of him, and he took to his bed. He was quite sick for three days. He had a hard battle to fight. He needs a great work done for him before he can be a true missionary."},{"refcode_short":"15MR 369.4","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 15 [Nos. 1136-1185], p. 369.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Light, precious light, was breaking in.

I slept but little Friday night, but went into the ministers’ meeting in the morning. I opened the meeting with prayer; the Lord poured upon me the spirit of supplication for my ministering brethren. Angels of God were in the building. Daniel broke out in most urgent prayer. He confessed and confessed, and pleaded for the forgiveness of God. Prayers and tears were mingled together. It was a most precious season. I bore a message with many tears, stating the solemn work of the watchmen and the necessity of faithfulness. The power of God rested upon me and upon those who heard. I never heard Brother Matteson talk as he did in that meeting. He seemed so humble, and his face shone with spiritual light. Every testimony was borne with deepest feeling. The crust over Elder Andrews is breaking. Daniel made a good confession in every way."},{"refcode_short":"15MR 370.2","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 15 [Nos. 1136-1185], p. 370.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"What a precious meeting this was to us all. The Lord's presence was in the meeting, and His power to bless. This has been a season of taxing labor to me, but the Lord has given me strength for my day. Daniel says he is now going to cease building up himself, and propping up Daniel Bourdeau, and poring over his past difficulties. He says he never loved his brethren as now. He is going to talk faith and hope and courage, and be a strong man for God. May the Lord give him might in the inner man. He says the peace of God is in his heart.—Letter 23, 1885."}]
