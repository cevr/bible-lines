This longing, implanted by a merciful God, has been perverted by Satan. He makes people believe that this deep hunger may be satisfied by pleasure, wealth, ease, fame, or power. But those who have been thus deceived by him find that all these things leave the soul unsatisfied."},{"refcode_short":"HLv 5.2","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 5.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"God designs, however, that this longing shall lead to the One who alone is able to satisfy it. The desire is of Him that it may lead to Him, the fullness and fulfillment of that desire. That fullness is found in Jesus Christ, the Son of the Eternal God. Haggai calls Him “the Desire of all nations,” and we may well call Him “the Desire of all ages,” God's Son, sent from heaven with love."},{"refcode_short":"HLv 5.3","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 5.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"This book sets forth Jesus Christ as the One in whom the deep yearnings of every heart may be satisfied. It is not, however, the purpose of this work to provide a harmony of the Gospels or to set forth in strictly chronological order the important events and wonderful lessons of the life of Christ. Its purpose is to present the love of God as revealed in His Son, the divine beauty of the life of Christ."},{"refcode_short":"HLv 5.4","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 5.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In the following pages the author opens before the reader undreamed-of riches from the life of Jesus. New and glorious light flashes forth from many familiar passages of Scripture. Jesus Christ is revealed as the Fullness of the Godhead, the infinitely merciful Saviour of sinners, the Sun of Righteousness, the merciful High Priest, mankind's compelling Example, the Healer of all human maladies and diseases, the tender, compassionate Friend, the Prince of Peace, the Coming King, the culmination and fruition of the desires and hopes of all the ages."},{"refcode_short":"HLv 6.1","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 6.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"We send forth this book with the prayer that the Holy Spirit will make its words, words of life to millions whose longings and desires are yet unsatisfied."},{"refcode_short":"HLv 11","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 11 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Chapter 1—Christ Before Coming to Earth"},{"refcode_short":"HLv 11.1","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 11.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"From the days of eternity the Lord Jesus Christ was one with the Father; He was the image of God, the outshining of His glory. To manifest this glory, to reveal the light of God's love, He came to our sin-darkened earth. Therefore it was prophesied of Him, “They shall call His name Immanuel, ... God with us.” Matthew 1:23; cf. Isaiah 7:14."},{"refcode_short":"HLv 11.2","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 11.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Jesus was “the Word of God”—God's thought made audible. Not alone for His earthborn children was this revelation given. Our little world is the lesson book of the universe. Both redeemed and unfallen beings will find in the cross of Christ their science and their song. They will see that the glory shining in the face of Jesus is the glory of self-sacrificing love. They will see that the law of life for earth and heaven is the law of self-renouncing love. That love which “seeketh not her own” has its source in the heart of God and is manifested in Jesus, the meek and lowly One."},{"refcode_short":"HLv 11.3","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 11.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In the beginning, Christ laid the foundations of the earth. His hand hung the worlds in space and fashioned the flowers of the field. He filled the earth with beauty, and the air with song. See Psalms 65:6; 95:5. Upon all things He wrote the message of the Father's love."},{"refcode_short":"HLv 11.4","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 11.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Now sin has marred God's perfect work, yet that handwriting remains. Nothing, save the selfish heart of man, lives unto itself. Every tree and shrub and leaf pours forth that element of life without which neither man nor animal could live; and man and animal, in turn, minister to the life of tree and shrub and leaf. The ocean receives streams from every land, but takes to give. The mists ascending from it fall in showers to water the earth, that it may bring forth and bud. The angels of glory find their joy in giving. They bring light from above, and move upon the human spirit to bring the lost into fellowship with Christ."},{"refcode_short":"HLv 12.1","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 12.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"But turning from all lesser representations, we behold God in Jesus. We see that it is the glory of God to give. “I seek not Mine own glory,” said Christ, but the glory of Him that sent Me. John 8:50; 7:18. Christ received from God, but He took to give. Through the Son, the Father's life flows out to all; through the Son it returns in joyous service, a tide of love, to the great Source of all. Thus through Christ the circuit of beneficence is complete."},{"refcode_short":"HLv 12","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 12 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In Heaven This Law Was Broken!"},{"refcode_short":"HLv 12.2","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 12.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Sin originated in self-seeking. Lucifer, the covering cherub, desired to be first in heaven. He sought to draw heavenly beings away from their Creator and win homage to himself. Investing the Creator with his own evil characteristics, he led angels to doubt the word of God and distrust His goodness. Satan caused them to look upon Him as severe and unforgiving. Thus he deceived angels. Thus he deceived men, and the night of woe settled down upon the world."},{"refcode_short":"HLv 12.3","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 12.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The earth was dark through misapprehension of God. That the world might be brought back to God, Satan's deceptive power was to be broken. This could not be done by force. God desires only the service of love, and love cannot be won by force or authority. Only by love is love awakened. To know God is to love Him; His character must be manifested in contrast to that of Satan. This work only one Being could do. Only He who knew the height and depth of the love of God could make it known."},{"refcode_short":"HLv 12.4","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 12.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The plan for our redemption was not a plan formulated after the fall of Adam. It was a revelation of “the mystery which hath been kept in silence through times eternal.” Romans 16:25, RV. It was an unfolding of the principles that from eternal ages have been the foundation of God's throne. God foresaw sin's existence and made provision to meet the terrible emergency. He covenanted to give His only-begotten Son, “that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” John 3:16."},{"refcode_short":"HLv 13.1","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 13.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Lucifer had said, “I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; ...

Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of Me,) to do Thy will, O God.” Hebrews 10:5-7. Christ was about to visit our world, to become incarnate. Had He appeared with the glory that was His before the world was, we could not have endured the light of His presence. That we might behold it and not be destroyed, His glory was shrouded, His divinity veiled with humanity."},{"refcode_short":"HLv 13.4","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 13.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"This great purpose had been shadowed forth in types and symbols. The burning bush, in which Christ appeared to Moses, revealed God. The lowly shrub, that seemingly had no attractions, enshrined the Infinite. God shrouded His glory that Moses could look upon it and live. So in the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night, God's glory was veiled, that finite men might behold it. So Christ was to come “in the likeness of men.” He was the incarnate God, but His glory was veiled that He might draw near to sorrowful, tempted men."},{"refcode_short":"HLv 13.5","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 13.5 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Through Israel's weary wandering in the desert, the symbol of God's presence, the sanctuary, was with them. See Exodus 25:8. So Christ pitched His tent by the side of the tents of men that He might make us familiar with His divine character and life. “The Word became flesh, and tabernacled among us (and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father), full of grace and truth.” John 1:14, RV, margin."},{"refcode_short":"HLv 14.1","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 14.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Since Jesus came to dwell with us, every son and daughter of Adam may understand that our Creator is the friend of sinners. In every divine attraction in the Saviour's life on earth, we see “God with us.”"},{"refcode_short":"HLv 14.2","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 14.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Satan represents God's law of love as a law of selfishness. He declares it impossible for us to obey its precepts. The fall of our first parents he charges upon the Creator, leading men to look upon God as the author of sin, suffering, and death. Jesus was to unveil this deception. As one of us He was to give an example of obedience. For this He took upon Himself our nature, and passed through our experiences. “In all things it behooved Him to be made like unto His brethren.” Hebrews 2:17. If we had to bear anything which Jesus did not endure, then on this point Satan would represent the power of God as insufficient for us. Therefore Jesus was “in all points tempted like as we are.” Hebrews 4:15. He endured every trial to which we are subject. And He exercised in His own behalf no power not freely offered us. As man, He met temptation and overcame in the strength given Him from God. He made plain the character of God's law, and His life testifies that it is possible for us also to obey the law of God."},{"refcode_short":"HLv 14.3","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 14.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"By His humanity, Christ touched humanity; by His divinity, He lays hold on the throne of God. As Son of man, He gave us an example of obedience; as Son of God, He gives us power to obey. To us He says, “All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth.” Matthew 28:18. “God with us” is the surety of our deliverance from sin, the assurance of power to obey the law of heaven. Christ revealed a character the opposite of that of Satan. “Being found in human form He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross.” Philippians 2:8, RSV. Christ took the form of a servant, and offered sacrifice, Himself the priest, Himself the victim. “He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him.” Isaiah 53:5."},{"refcode_short":"HLv 15","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 15 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Treated As We Deserve"},{"refcode_short":"HLv 15.1","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 15.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Christ was treated as we deserve, that we might be treated as He deserves. He was condemned for our sins, in which He had no share, that we might be justified by His righteousness, in which we had no share. He suffered the death which was ours, that we might receive the life which was His. “With His stripes we are healed.” Isaiah 53:5."},{"refcode_short":"HLv 15.2","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 15.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"It was Satan's purpose to bring eternal separation between God and man; but in taking our nature, the Saviour bound Himself to humanity by a tie that is never to be broken. “God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son.” John 3:16. He gave Him, not only to die as our sacrifice; He gave Him to become one of the human family, forever to retain His human nature."},{"refcode_short":"HLv 15.3","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 15.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"“Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon His shoulder.” God has adopted human nature in the person of His Son, and has carried it to the highest heaven.

The Omnipotent One is made known as the God of love. Satan's charges are refuted, and his character unveiled. Sin can never again enter the universe.

But with many of the people the motive was selfish. They rendered service to God as the means of attaining national greatness. They did not become the light of the world but shut themselves away in order to escape temptation. God had placed restrictions on association with idolaters to prevent them from conforming to the practices of the heathen. But this teaching had been misinterpreted. It was used to build up a wall between Israel and other nations.

Widespread discontent, greed, violence, distrust, and spiritual apathy were eating out the heart of the nation.

The ritual economy had no value apart from Him. When the Jews sealed their rejection of Christ by delivering Him to death, they rejected all that gave significance to the temple and its services. Its sacredness had departed. It was doomed to destruction. From that day sacrificial offerings were meaningless. In putting Christ to death, the Jews virtually destroyed their temple.

The fountain of the heart must be purified before the stream can become pure. He who is trying to reach heaven by his own works in keeping the law is attempting an impossibility.

By an agency as unseen as the wind, Christ is constantly working on the heart. Little by little, impressions are made that tend to draw the soul to Christ. These may be received through reading the Scriptures or hearing the Word from the living preacher. Suddenly, as the Spirit comes with more direct appeal, the soul gladly surrenders to Jesus.

Sinful thoughts are put away, evil deeds renounced. Love, humility, and peace take the place of anger, envy, and strife. Joy takes the place of sadness.

We cannot even repent without the aid of the Spirit of God.

Then the Spirit of God through faith produces a new life in the soul. The thoughts and desires are brought into obedience to Christ. The heart, the mind, are created anew in the image of Him who works in us to subdue all things to Himself.

They originate in man's desire to exalt himself above God, but result in degrading man below the brute. Every false religion teaches its adherents to be careless of human needs, sufferings, and rights.

So also when a man who has been under strong delusion comes to understand moral truth. The change in human hearts, the transformation of human characters, is a miracle that reveals an ever-living Saviour. In preaching the Word of God, the sign that should be manifest now and always is the presence of the Holy Spirit, to make the Word a regenerating power to those that hear."},{"refcode_short":"HLv 273.4","refcode_long":"From Heaven With Love, p. 273.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Those who desired a sign from Jesus had hardened their hearts.

In requiring tribute from Jesus, the rabbis were setting aside His claim as a prophet and were dealing with Him as with any commonplace person.

If Thou do these things, show Thyself to the world.” If He knew He was the Messiah, why this strange reserve?

When He had said these words unto them, He abode still in Galilee.” His brothers had spoken to Him in a tone of authority.

The perception and appreciation of truth, He said, depends less upon the mind than on the heart. Truth claims the homage of the will. It is to be received through the work of grace in the heart; and its reception depends on the renunciation of every sin that the Spirit of God reveals. There must be a conscientious surrender of every habit and practice opposed to its principles. Those who thus yield themselves to God will be able to distinguish between him who speaks for God and him who speaks merely from himself.

According to the law, every child must be circumcised on the eighth day. Should the appointed time fall on the Sabbath, the rite must then be performed.

He was full of the vigor of manhood's prime. Why not go to the vast fields of the world with the words of His grace, the touch of His healing power? Why not give light and gladness to those darkened and sorrowing millions? Why face death now and leave the work in its infancy? The foe assailed Christ with fierce and subtle temptations.

This statement, made before the raising of Lazarus, left no room for Christ's enemies to say that a deception had been practiced. When Christ raised the daughter of Jairus, He had said, “The damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.” Mark 5:39. As she had been raised immediately after her death, the Pharisees declared that the child had not been dead, that Christ Himself said she was only asleep.

He was lessening the authority of the rulers, and if the people were to lose confidence in their rulers, the national power would be destroyed. After this miracle, the followers of Jesus would likely rise in revolt. The Romans would then come, he said, close our temple, and destroy us as a nation.

The mind is energized to break down every barrier that has caused alienation. Sins are confessed; they are forgiven. The subduing grace of Christ draws hearts together.

It was past midnight. Bound and closely guarded, the Saviour moved painfully to the palace of Annas, the ex-high priest. Annas was the head of the officiating priestly family, and in deference to his age he was recognized by the people as high priest. His counsel was sought as the voice of God. He must be present at the examination of the prisoner, for fear that the less-experienced Caiaphas might fail of securing the object for which they were working.

Under Roman rule the Sanhedrin could only examine a prisoner and pass judgment, to be ratified by the Roman authorities. It was therefore necessary to bring against Christ charges regarded as criminal by the Romans and also in the eyes of the Jews. Not a few priests and rulers had been convicted by Christ's teaching. Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus were not now to be summoned, but others might dare to speak in favor of justice. The trial must unite the Sanhedrin against Christ.

He said, You see that all I revealed to you concerning My rejection as the Messiah has come to pass.

It is fatal to suppose that the work of saving souls depends on the ordained minister alone. For this work, the church was established, and all who take its vows are pledged to be co-workers with Christ. Whatever one's calling in life, his first interest should be to win souls for Christ. He may not be able to speak to congregations, but he can work for individuals. Nigh and afar off are souls weighed down by guilt. It is not hardship or poverty that degrades humanity.

He imparted His life to the sick and those possessed of demons. He knew that those who petitioned Him for help had brought disease on themselves, yet He did not refuse to heal them. And many were healed of their spiritual disease as well as their physical maladies. The gospel still possesses the same power. Christ feels the woes of every sufferer. When fever is burning up the life current, He feels the agony. He is just as willing to heal now as when He was personally on earth.

The cure could be wrought only by the power of the Great Healer, but Christ made use of simple and natural remedies. He taught that disease is the result of violating God's laws, both natural and spiritual. The great misery in the world would not exist if men lived in harmony with the Creator's plan. He taught that health is the reward of obedience to the laws of God. The Great Physician had spoken to His people from the pillar of cloud: “If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and wilt do that which is right in His sight, ...

There were places where the Saviour Himself could not do many mighty works because of their unbelief. So now unbelief separates the church from her divine Helper.

How would a mother and father feel if they knew that their child, lost in the cold and the snow, had been left to perish by those who might have saved it?

So His servants are to present the riches of the unspeakable Gift. The wonderful love of Christ will melt and subdue hearts, when the mere reiteration of doctrines would accomplish nothing. Words alone cannot tell it. Let it be manifested in the life. Christ is sitting for His portrait in every disciple.

He upbraided them not for their faults and failures; words of deep tenderness were the last that fell from the lips of their Lord. With hands outstretched in blessing, as if in assurance of His protecting care, He slowly ascended from among them, drawn heavenward by a power stronger than any earthly attraction. As He passed upward, the disciples strained for the last glimpse of their ascending Lord.
