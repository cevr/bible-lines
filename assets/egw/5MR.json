The high priest was required to make the most careful and solemn preparation, and he must guard himself with the utmost diligence from all contamination. How much more while the antitypical atonement is going on in heaven, should those who minister in sacred things be holy. “Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord.” Said Christ, “I sanctify Myself that they also may be sanctified.” Those who are sent to the people in Christ's stead should be men of God, pure in life, pure in conversation, ensamples to the flock.

We want to show to the world that we have a faith that is elevating, that it makes us kind, courteous, self-denying; and begets in us love and reverence for God, and makes us Christian ladies and gentlemen. We must pray more earnestly for the grace of Christ which is essential for us if we preserve our integrity and spiritual life.

They must be converted, their thoughts must be directed in a divine channel. We have a mighty soul-purifying truth, and this truth is to sanctify us individually. Satan has come down with great power, knowing that his time is short. He will overthrow the faith of some in this assembly unless we keep close to Jesus. We are warned that he [Satan] will work with all power and signs and lying wonders, and therefore we want to be building up a firm character.

Jesus loves all these souls better than you can love them. You have your work to do. It is a responsible work, but you are not to look at it until it assumes so large proportions, that it hides Jesus from your sight. You are pained because many are satisfied with the form of godliness, while denying the power thereof. They look with satisfaction in the performance of outward ceremonies, and yet there is no evidence that they are virtually connected with God. They are deceived in regard to their condition, and this deception is hard to break up. They know little of the depths of their own natural corruption, or of the infinite holiness of God. They do not realize that the foundation of all their faith and hope should only be the perfection of Jesus our surety. The only genuine saving faith is that which lays hold upon the imputed righteousness of Christ. He is the only source of virtue, of spiritual power and life. Each must have a knowledge of God for himself, must have faith in Jesus Christ whom God hath sent. When the members of the church have this experience Christian virtues will shine forth, and they will be clothed with humility. The fruit of this faith will be love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness and goodness, and the object of their lives will be to glorify God day by day."},{"refcode_short":"5MR 10.1","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 5 [Nos. 260-346], p. 10.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In looking upon the professed followers of Christ you see great deficiencies in the church, in families, and individuals: but you cannot make one soul clean.

You say, “I have heard that we are not saved for our good works.” No, but we will not be saved without them. You cannot depend upon your good works for salvation. We must have a living dependence upon a living God. And when there is a living connection with a living God, Christ abides in the heart by living faith, and the human agent works after Christ's life. He is going to change our life and character that Christ reveals. And if trials come to us we will not manifest a rebellious spirit. The opportunities will present themselves to every one of us, because we see oppression and unkindness, and because we see burdens that would be thrown upon us, and let self come in and exhibit itself. We let self arise. We want to put the trials in the right place, and where is it? Christ says to everyone that is weary and heavy laden, “Come to Me.” And what? “Learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.” And notwithstanding the crush of conflict that we shall have to pass through if we accept the truth of heavenly origin, there is meekness and lowliness in Jesus in every move.

It is a work of mercy, a work of love, a work just in Christ's lines. Just as Christ worked. He says that the nobleman went a long journey, and to every man he gave his work. The human agent is to cooperate with the divine. To everyone his work, and this is Christ's work. It is not the man's work. He is not to feel that all he has to do is to attend to his own individual self. No, there is a broader field. He is to occupy till I come, and what is it, “to occupy”? To be laborers together with God. Therefore it is of the greatest consequence that we understand in clear lines what it is to be laborers together with God. We must be imbued with the Spirit of Christ. We cannot labor with God merely from our intellect or our education. We cannot buy the grace of God with money; we cannot buy it with eloquence; we cannot buy it with the power of our intellect. It is God's to begin with. Does any of it belong to us? No, it is received by us from above. We are to occupy to the very best knowledge that we have, and sense our responsibility, and let our light shine through us to those that are around us, and in doing that we are doing the work of God. “Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?” How are we to do it though? It is to present the obedience to Jesus Christ. And when we present the perfection that there is in His requirements, in His commandments, in His law, we are presenting that which will loose the bands of wickedness, and in the place of making men fast, in the place of shackling them with sin, it will loose the bands of wickedness, and those that are oppressed by the enemy. Who is the enemy? Who is observing us on the right and on the left? It is the one who rebelled against the law of God in heaven. It is the one that fell because of his disloyalty, and when we work in his lines we are fastening the shackles of oppression. “His servants ye are to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey.” If it is Christ you obey you are free, because He came to make us free. If we are on Christ's side we stand under the blood-stained banner of Jesus Christ. The blood-stained banner of Prince Emmanuel testifies that we are free, made free in Jesus Christ, because He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but for all who shall believe on His name.

We must search the Scriptures for ourselves and know what they teach. We must obey what God says. “Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor which are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?” How can you do this? By not living extravagantly yourself.

Why, He found when He came here that the truth was so mixed with error, that He had to take away the traditions and maxims, and to remove the rubbish, and take the truth which had served in the enemy's lines to strengthen error, and bring error before the people, rescue it from error and restore it to the native loveliness of its character, and then let that truth stand before the people. The oldest error may be pleaded because of its age, but it may be hoary with age, but that does not make error truth. No, it does not change error into truth. The Jews held their customs received from tradition and repeated from age to age and from generation to generation, and they kept accumulating till He says to them, “Ye are blind.” “Ye are both ignorant of the Scriptures and of the power of God.” What was the matter? Why they had taught tradition for the commandments of God? That is not the way to do. What did Christ come to present? He says, “The recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised.” Now you can see that that is in perfect harmony with what we have been reading. “When thou seest the naked that thou cover him.” What are you doing if you have the glorious light of truth? What are you doing if God has chosen you to be a peculiar people, a royal people, a holy people?

They exclude everyone. There was a seamstress taken in by a noble family, and they [the people in the church] were highly offended and talked with them. To think that they should let one worker come in! Have they got a secluded heaven? They are hiding themselves from their own flesh. Do just as Jesus did. What did He do? He took a position with the poor. He preached the gospel to the poor in such simple language that they could advance the truth in every line. What does it say in the Scriptures? Christ sent out a message, Come to My supper. The preparation is made, come to My supper. But they would not hear it. What was the matter? What had they got to do? One said, “I have bought a piece of ground and cannot come,” and another said, “I have a yoke of oxen,” and another, “I have married a wife,” and Christ was angry, and He said, “Go out onto the highways and compel them to come in.” How? Were they to take and shackle them? They were to let the bright rays of light shine right upon them in clear, steady, lines that they should follow the words of Jesus. “And I, if I be lifted up... will draw men unto Me.” Do you draw them unto Him? That is the very work that is to be done. Let us draw. Shall we go to the highest? Yes, go to the highest powers in the earth and say, “We have got a truth which will satisfy every one of you. You are not satisfied. This is a truth so large and expansive and so deep that it will meet every want that you have.” Present to them the precious truth. There are many in palaces that do not know what is the matter with them. Paul had converts in Caesar's household. He did not tell them to come out, but when it came to the point where they could not honor God and stay there, they had a perfect right to change their position, as Christ had the right to take the children of Israel out of Egypt in order that they might keep the Sabbath and have the Lord of heaven exalted before them."},{"refcode_short":"5MR 42.1","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 5 [Nos. 260-346], p. 42.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Hide not yourself from your own flesh.

What is a disciple? A learner, ever learning. Coming events, of a solemn character, are opening before us, and God would not have any one of us think that in these last days there is no more that we need to know. This is a continual snare of Satan. He would have us meet coming events without that special preparation which is essential to guide them through every difficulty. He would have all stumbling their way along in ignorance, making self-conceit, self-esteem, self-confidence, take the place of true knowledge. The more satisfied anyone is with himself, and his present knowledge, the less earnestly and humbly will he seek to be guided into all truth. The less of the Holy Spirit of God he has, the more self-satisfied and complacent he will feel. He will not search earnestly and with the deepest interest to know more of truth. But unless he keeps pace with the Leader, who is guiding into all truth, he will be left behind, belated, blinded, confused, because he is not walking in the light.... The word of God is to be the man of our counsel.... All heaven is looking upon the remnant people of God, to see if they will make truth alone their shield and buckler. Unless the truth is presented as it is in Jesus, and is planted in the heart by the power of the Spirit of God, even ministers will be found drifting away from Christ, away from piety, away from religious principle.

As living branches of the True Vine, all will be united to Christ the living Head. Christ will abide in every heart, guiding, comforting, sanctifying, and presenting to the world the unity of the followers of Jesus, thus bearing testimony that the heavenly credentials are supplied to the remnant church.

I suffered much at the commencement of the meeting. Unbelief seemed to be on every hand. There was one sister there that was called very spiritual. She had traveled and been a powerful preacher the most of the time for twenty years. She had been truly a mother in Israel. But a division had risen in the band on the shut door. She had great sympathy, and could not believe the door was shut. (I had known nothing of their differences.) Sister Durben [Dearborn?] got up to talk. I felt very, very sad. At length my soul seemed to be in an agony, and while she was talking I fell from my chair to the floor. It was then I had a view of Jesus rising from His mediatorial throne and going to the Holiest as Bridegroom to receive His kingdom. They were all deeply interested in the view. They all said it was entirely new to them. The Lord worked in mighty power setting the truth home to their hearts. Sister Durben [Dearborn?] knew what the power of the Lord was, for she had felt it many times; and a short time after I fell she was struck down, and fell to the floor, crying to God to have mercy on her. When I came out of vision, my ears were saluted with Sister Durben's [Dearborn's?] singing and shouting with a loud voice. Most of them received the vision, and were settled upon the shut door. Previous to this I had no light on the coming of the Bridegroom, but had expected Him to [come to] this earth to deliver His people on the tenth day of the seventh month. I did not hear a lecture or a word in any way relating to the Bridegroom's going to the Holiest."},{"refcode_short":"5MR 98.1","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 5 [Nos. 260-346], p. 98.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I had but very few privileges in 1842, 1843 and 1844.

It will not be surprising if we have to suffer, if we are tried.

We have no words, no contention, all moves along harmoniously in my large family, for I do not attempt to dictate what they shall or shall not eat. Many years ago, while at Dr. Jackson's, I undertook to leave it [salt] off entirely, because he advocated this in his lectures. But he came to me and said, “I request you not to come into the dining hall to eat. A moderate use of salt is necessary to you; without it you will become a dyspeptic. I will send your meals to your room.” After a while, however, I again tried the saltless food, but was again reduced in strength and fainted from weakness.

The teaching of this parable is applicable to the church of God at this time. When troubles assail, do not go for help to lawyers not of our faith. God would not have us open church difficulties before those who do not fear Him. Let God's people agree as touching the thing they desire, and then let them unite in offering prayer to God, persevering in asking for deliverance. God would not have us depend for help upon those who do not obey His requirements. They have not that wisdom that cometh down from above. Those who trust in such counselors show that they have not faith in God. They dishonor Him by appealing to unbelievers to settle difficulties in the church. What do they think they will gain by opening to lawyers the supposed wrongdoings of their fellow church members? ..."},{"refcode_short":"5MR 417.1","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 5 [Nos. 260-346], p. 417.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Much pride of heart has been revealed by the professed people of God.

In the twenty-first verse the solemn charge is given: “I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.” These verses, 21 and 22, need to be carefully and prayerfully considered.

Do they humble their heart before God and by faith lay hold on the grace of Christ and put away their sins and believe their repentance is accepted before God? Have they piety?

They do good service for Satan by communicating those evil thoughts to another mind, setting him to watch with keen scrutiny, to think and speak evil of his brethren, and to pass along the dish prepared by Satan to poison others.
