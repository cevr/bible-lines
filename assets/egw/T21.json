Where much is at stake, and where matters of vital consequence are to be entered into, and important questions settled, God's servants should take individual responsibilities.

It is only by exercising principle in the small transactions of ordinary life that we are tested and our characters formed. In the varied circumstances of life we are tested and proved and thereby we acquire a power to stand the greater and more important tests that we are called to endure, and are qualified to fill still more important positions. The mind must be trained through daily tests to habits of fidelity, to a sense of the claims of right and duty above inclination and pleasure Minds thus trained are not wavering between right and wrong, as the trembling reed in the wind, but as soon as matters come before them, they discern at once that there is a principle involved, and they will instinctively choose the right without long debating the matter. They are loyal because they have trained themselves to habits of faithfulness and truth. By being faithful in that which is least, it becomes easy for them, through acquired power, to be faithful in greater matters."},{"refcode_short":"T21 25.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 21, p. 25.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Bro. ——'s education has not been such as to strengthen the high moral qualities that would enable him to stand alone in the strength of God in defense of truth, amid the severest opposition, firm as a rock to principle, true to his moral character, unmoved by censure, or human praise, or rewards, preferring death rather than a violated conscience.

He requires of them to obey natural law, to preserve physical health. Nature's path is the road he marks out, and it is broad enough for any Christian. God has, with a lavish hand, provided us with rich and varied bounties for our sustenance and enjoyment. In order for us to enjoy the natural appetite which will preserve health and prolong life, he restricts the appetite. He says, Beware, restrain, deny, unnatural appetite.

Respiration is more free and easy if bathing is practiced, whether sick, or well. By bathing, the muscles become more flexible, the mind and body are alike invigorated, the intellect is brighter, and every faculty is livelier. The bath is a soother of nerves. It promotes general perspiration, quickens the circulation, overcomes obstructions in the system and acts beneficially on the kidneys and urinary organs. Bathing helps the bowels, stomach, and liver, giving energy and new life to each. Digestion is promoted by bathing, and instead of the system being weakened, it is strengthened. Instead of increasing the liabilities to cold, a bath properly taken fortifies against cold, because the circulation is improved, and the uterine organs, which are more or less congested, are relieved, for the blood is brought to the surface, and a more easy and regular flow of the blood through all the blood-vessels is obtained."},{"refcode_short":"T21 104.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 21, p. 104.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Experience is said to be the best teacher.

The exercise of one muscle, while other muscles are left with nothing to do, will not strengthen the inactive ones any more than the use of one of the organs of the mind, if continually exercised, will develop and strengthen the organs not brought into use. Each faculty of the mind and each muscle have their distinctive office, and all require to be exercised in order to become properly developed and retain healthful vigor. Each organ and muscle has its work to do in the living organism. Every wheel in the machinery must be a living, active, working wheel. Nature's fine and wonderful works need to be kept in active motion in order to perform the object for which they were designed. All the faculties have a bearing upon each other, and all need to be exercised, in order to be properly developed.

False statements have placed us in a wrong position before the people, and this is in the way of many embracing the truth. If they are made to believe that those who occupy responsible positions in the work at Battle Creek are designing and fanatical, they conclude that the entire work is wrong, and that our views of Bible truth must be incorrect, and they fear to investigate and receive the truth. But we are not to go forth to call the people to look to us; we are not to generally speak of ourselves, and vindicate our character; but to speak the truth, exalt the truth, speak of Jesus, exalt Jesus, and this, attended by the power of God will remove prejudice and disarm opposition. Brn. —— and —— love to write; so does my husband. And God has let his light shine upon his word and let him into a field of rich thought that would be a blessing to the people of God at large. While he has borne a triple burden, some of his ministering brethren have let the responsibility drop heavily upon him, consoling themselves with the thought that God had placed Bro. White at the head of the work and qualified him for it, and he had not fitted them for the position therefore they have not taken the responsibility and borne the burdens they might have borne,"},{"refcode_short":"T21 138.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 21, p. 138.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"There should be men to feel the same interest my husband has felt. There never has been a more important period in the history of Seventh-day Adventists than at the present time. Instead of the publishing work diminishing, the demand for our publications is greatly increasing. There will be more to do instead of less. My husband has been murmured against so much, and has contended with jealousy and falsehood so long, and he has seen so little faithfulness in men, that he has become suspicious of almost every one, even of his own brethren in the ministry. The ministering brethren have felt this, and for fear that they should not move wisely, in many instances, have not moved at all. But the time has come when these men must unitedly labor and lift the burdens. The ministering brethren lack faith and confidence in God. They believe the truth, and in the fear of God they should unite their efforts and bear the burdens of this work which God has laid upon them. If after one has done the best he can in his judgment, and the other thinks he can see where he could have improved the matter, he should kindly and patiently give the brother the benefit of his judgment, but should not censure or question his integrity of purpose any sooner than he would wish to be suspected or unjustly censured himself. If the brother who feels the cause of God at heart sees, in his earnest efforts to do, that he has made a failure, he will feel deeply over the matter, for he will be inclined to distrust himself, and lose confidence in his own judgment; nothing will weaken his courage and God-like manhood, like a sense of his mistakes and errors that he has made in the work God has appointed him to do, which work he loves better than his life. How unjust then for his brethren that discover his errors to keep pressing the thorn deeper and deeper into his heart, to make him feel more intensely when with every thrust he is weakening faith, courage, and confidence, in himself to do, and to work successfully in the upbuilding of the cause of God. Frequently the truth and facts are to be plainly spoken to the erring to make them see and feel their error, that they may reform. But this should ever be done with pitying tenderness, not with harshness or severity, but consider their own weakness, lest they also be tempted. When the fault is seen and acknowledged, then comfort should be given instead of grieving him, and seeking to make him feel more deeply. In the sermon of Christ upon the mount, he said, “Judge not, that ye be not judged; for with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.” Our Saviour reproved for rash judgment. “Why beholdest thou the mote in thy brother's eye;” and, “behold a beam is in thine own eye,” It is frequently the case that while one is quick to discern the errors of his brethren, he may be in greater faults himself, and is blind to his own errors. We should, all who are followers of Christ, deal with one another exactly as we wish the Lord to deal with us in our errors and weaknesses, for we are all erring, and need pity and forgiveness of God. Jesus consented to take human nature, that he might know how to pity, and that he might know how to plead with his Father in behalf of sinful, erring mortals. He volunteered to become man's advocate, and he humiliated himself to become acquainted with the temptations wherewith man was beset, that he might succor those who should be tempted, and he be a tender and faithful high priest."},{"refcode_short":"T21 141.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 21, p. 141.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"There is frequent necessity for plainly rebuking sin and reproving wrong. But ministers engaged in the work of the salvation of their fellow-men, should not be pitiless toward the errors of one another, and should not make prominent the defects in their organization. They should not expose or reprove their weaknesses. They should inquire if such a course would bring about the desired effect with themselves, would it increase their love for, and confidence in, the one who thus made prominent their mistakes. Especially should the mistakes of ministers who are engaged in the work of God be kept within as small a circle as possible, for there are many weak ones who will take advantage if they are aware that those who minister in word and doctrine have weaknesses like other men. And it is a most cruel thing for the faults of a minister to be exposed to unbelievers, if that minister in future is counted worthy to labor for the salvation of souls. No good can come of this exposure, but only harm. God frowns upon this course, for it is undermining the confidence of the people in those whom God accepts to carry forward his work. The character of every fellow-laborer should be jealously guarded by brother ministers. Saith God, “Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm,” Love and confidence should be cherished. A lack of love and confidence in one minister for another does not increase the happiness of the one thus deficient, but as he makes his brother unhappy, he is unhappy himself. There is greater power in love than was ever found in censure. Love will melt its way through barriers, while censure will close up every avenue of the soul."},{"refcode_short":"T21 142.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 21, p. 142.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"My husband must have a change.

This independence will keep the mind calm, and unchangeable amidst the multitudinous errors which are prevailing, and will lead those in responsible positions to look carefully at the evidence on every side, and not be swerved by the influence of others, or by the surroundings, to form conclusions without intelligent and thorough knowledge of all the circumstances."},{"refcode_short":"T21 159.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 21, p. 159.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The investigation of cases in Battle Creek was very much after the order that a lawyer criticises a witness, and there was a decided absence of the Spirit of God.

Many fathers and mothers are poor in the midst of abundance. They abridge, in a degree, their own personal comforts, and frequently deny themselves those things necessary for the enjoyment of life and health, while they have ample means at their command. They feel, as it were, forbidden to appropriate their means for their own comfort or for charitable purposes. They have one object before them, which is to save property to leave for their children. This idea is so prominent, so interwoven with all their actions, that children learn to look forward to this property finally to be theirs. They depend on it. And this prospect has an important, but not a favorable, influence upon their characters. Some become spendthrifts, others, selfish and avaricious. Some are indolent and reckless. Many do not cultivate habits of economy. They do not seek to become self-reliant. They are aimless, and have but little stability of character.
