It related to a business transaction connected with the Buena Vista property. A lot containing over seventeen acres of land, situated next to the school property, one of our worker was thinking of purchasing for the purpose of establishing a cripples’ home, but was not willing to pay more than fifteen hundred dollars for it. The land could not be secured for less than two thousand. After the purchase was made, Brother Vaughan felt that he could not pay more than fifteen hundred dollars, and so the property was left on Elder Haskell’s hands. We felt that we could not let this piece of land go back into the hands of unbelievers, and Elder Haskell asked me if I would not buy it. I consented to do this, and the place is now in my name. To do this I have hired fifteen hundred dollars from the bank at eight per cent. Now Elder Haskell’s mind will be relieved, and he will not need to worry any longer.

The blessing of the Lord rested upon me as it did during the General Conference in Washington, and I knew that He had a message for me to bear. I presented before the people our responsibility to honor and glorify God by devoting ourselves unreservedly at home and abroad to His service, trying to convict souls of the truth and encouraging them by our prayers. I appealed to them to consecrate themselves to God, and the whole congregation arose in response to the invitation.

I have a special appeal to make on the necessity of raising means to carry through the determination to build a meetinghouse in Portland, Maine.

What could they do? I told them to do their best and that we would solicit means to help them. We had raised about two hundred dollars; I now wished the people in Mountain View to aid us. They raised about twenty-five dollars, but I think they will do more than that. While here in this place, Oakland, Calif., I called for help, and they helped us about thirty dollars; but I was glad that here in Oakland, where they have so many expenses to meet, they can do anything for us. Yesterday I spoke to the people at the Week of Prayer meeting, and they responded.

And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought: but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him. But God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.

Here is the great and precious gift of God—unity with Christ. “I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me. Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me. And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.” John 17:23-26."},{"refcode_short":"24LtMs, Ms 142, 1909, par. 20","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 24 (1909), Ms 142, 1909, par. 20","content":"Can any of the human family conceive anything more decidedly full and expressive than these words? It is then possible for each human being to be thoroughly identified with Christ the Son of God. Every truly converted soul shares in the same love of Christ and of one another that Christ presents to us that He has with the Father. His people are to be endowed with His divine nature, through their true conversion that they will then share in the love of the Father as Christ has that love. This is so expressed in character that it is decidedly expressed to the world. Oh, what an evidence is then given to the world that God has sent His Son into the world, that the world through Him—if they might receive Him and believe in Him—may be saved. This has been presented to me in such a decided representation that language cannot express this great love."},{"refcode_short":"24LtMs, Ms 142, 1909, par. 21","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 24 (1909), Ms 142, 1909, par. 21","content":"All who are changed in deed are brought into sacred nearness and fellowship in true conversion.

Now I resolve to try to impress this upon the minds of all, by pen and voice, that we may no more be so blinded and abused by Satan, but that our perception becomes pure and so sanctified that we may no longer become partakers of the satanic attributes to hurt one another by thought, by spirit, by words, or by deeds. If they will appreciate that prayer of Christ, everyone will be individually transformed in every sense of the word and dismiss those sentiments of selfish self-love, to seek to be first, and have honor as first, hankering for distinction. Sentiments of evil in speech creates suppositions in minds of those who profess to be Christians that are unkind, unjust, and cruel.

We are to be united and a strength and blessing to one another. When we will make room in our heart for love in the place of hatred, angels of God will be at work to transform the perverse, warped, selfish character and exhibitions will be made of entirely an opposite character from that which is now manifested."},{"refcode_short":"24LtMs, Ms 142, 1909, par. 24","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 24 (1909), Ms 142, 1909, par. 24","content":"As the state of things now are, many pray but do not make the effort to expel the evils out of their heart and dismiss the envy, evil surmises, and hatred.
