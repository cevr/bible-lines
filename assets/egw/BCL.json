These youth were greatly blessed in their effort to honor and please God by preserving their physical powers so that they would have mental strength, and so that God could mould and fashion them after the divine similitude. We read; “As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams....

Dr. Kellogg has been obtaining a most precious experience. But there are some who have acted as though they had been appointed to work against him. The Lord has reproved their course of action. They knew not that they were working on Satan's side of the question. As men and women have thus worked out their own attributes, this has been a hindrance to the doctor. His brethren have had evidence that he has been working in accordance with the will of God. But although they have had light on this point, they have not all stood by his side to help him. Some have held up his hands, but others have not heeded the admonitions given. Every evidence that could be given has been given, but some have shown that they have not practiced self-denial.

But the perceptions of our people have been blinded. They have not felt that the Lord has greatly honored His people in establishing the Sanitarium which for the influence and success has not yet been surpassed. Why cannot the churches see that the Sanitarium has success because the Lord is especially at work to make it a place where the truth may be made known in a way that will recommend it to all classes, where it will be made manifest that God is honored, and that the truth of His word is the abiding principle by which all work."},{"refcode_short":"BCL 15.1","refcode_long":"Battle Creek Letters, p. 15.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"This institution has been the means of elevating the truth, and bringing it before thousands.

The assurance they have that the Lord presides over the Sanitarium, the many prayers offered for the sick, does much to soothe their nerves. Many men and women who have never before thought of the value of their souls are convinced by the Spirit of God that they have made a mistake. They have put worldly position, human wisdom and wealth in the place of God and heaven. Careless, irreligious souls, full of pride and self-love, stand as it were before the bar of God, to consider their past and future; and not a few change the whole course of their life. Man has inherited an intense desire to save himself, and thus show his independence.

Their sins are taken away, and are placed at Christ's account. His righteousness is imputed to them. The healing balm is applied to the soul. They receive the grace of Christ, and go forth to impart to others the light of truth. The Lord makes them His witnesses. Their testimony is, “He was made sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him”.

Dr. Kellogg's connection with God enables him to take the presence of the Holy Spirit with him into assemblies where there is generally much levity, and where many things are spoken that might better be left unsaid.

God has planned the whole thing, that men in the highways as well as in byways should be brought in connection with Dr. Kellogg and his associates and the Bible instruction given. Thus they are continually being educated. Everything in this line that the physicians have done gives glory and praise to Him who is behind the physicians.

The ministry must not be divorced from this work, and the Lord would have the church act a part in this work. Every talent in our churches should be employed in the work of doing good. The rough places of nature, the wild places, God has made attractive, by placing beautiful things among the most unattractive. This is the work we are called to do.

These things I command you, that ye love one another.” God's servants are to watch and pray, losing no opportunity of speaking a word for Christ or of giving away a paper or a tract. The Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost. Christ's love for souls will fill the heart of the sincere worker.

Upon us rests the solemn obligation of taking a more decided stand for truth and righteousness than we have taken in the past. The line of demarcation between those who keep the commandments of God and those who do not, is to be revealed with unmistakable clearness. We are conscientiously to honor God, diligently using every means of keeping in covenant relation with Him, that we may receive His blessings,—the blessings so essential for the people who are to be severely tried. To give the impression that our faith, our religion is not a dominating power in our lives, is greatly to dishonor God.

He has taken upon himself responsibilities that I have not given him.” He was to be given another opportunity to establish his faith in the testimonies that for nearly half a century the Lord has been sending His people. Had he at that Conference fallen on the Rock, and been broken, had he come to God in humiliation and contrition, he would have received great light. But he allowed ambitious plans to occupy his mind. He has not taken time to study the Scriptures diligently, and he has not a true understanding of the work for these last days. He has not cherished a true, genuine faith,—a faith that would qualify him for the work of God. He has been in a dangerous position. Unless he places himself where he can be worked by the Holy Spirit, he will weave into his talks to the students that which is not true. He has planned to do a great work. But the Lord forbids us, as His appointed watchmen, stewards of His grace and shepherds of His flock, to allow him any longer to carry on the work in his own ambitious way.

His goodness and His power enabled Him to reveal in His life the truth that He came to this earth to bring to the fallen race. In every word, in every act, He manifested the love of God, cheering and encouraging the downcast and distressed. In heavenly wisdom He asserted His true majesty by bending all things to the present and future of human beings. He came to teach men and women how to live here below the life of which He gave them an example,—the life that will make them fit to enter the abodes of bliss."},{"refcode_short":"BCL 112.3","refcode_long":"Battle Creek Letters, p. 112.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In His breast mercy may be said to have held her court.

The day pointed out by prophecy is come. Jesus Christ is not understood. Jesus Christ is to them a fable. At this stage of the earth's history, many act like drunken men. “Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry; they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.

Their religious faith is just as is represented in this Scripture. Under its influence, they can not walk straight. They make crooked paths in their course of action. One and then another, they reel to and fro. They are looked upon by the Lord with great pity. The way of truth they have not known.

The world is to be flooded with specious fallacies. One human mind, accepting these fallacies, will work upon other human minds, who have been turning the precious evidence of God's truth into a lie. These men will be deceived by fallen angels, when they should have stood as faithful guardians, watching for souls, as they that must give an account.
