As soon as the child is capable of forming an idea, his education should begin. The teachers in the school will do something toward educating the youth, but the example of parents will do more than can be accomplished by any other means. Their conversation, the way in which they manage their business matters, the likes and dislikes to which they give expression, all help in molding the character.

As president of the General Conference, president of the Review and Herald Publishing Association, head of the editorial staff of the Review and Herald, and closely linked with the newly established Battle Creek College, James was soon caught up in the interests in Battle Creek and questioned the wisdom of returning to the west even though they were now building a house there. When he expressed his feeling on the subject, she answered, “While you are so happy [in the] east, I shall never ask you to cross the plains again. If you say, Stay east, thus it shall be.” (Letter 14, 1876). She suggested that they rent the new house for a brief period, and then added, “We will do exactly as you say. So advise or direct us and we will do as you say.” (Letter 8, 1876)."},{"refcode_short":"7MR 284.1","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 7 [Nos. 419-525], p. 284.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Both Ellen White and her husband had strong wills, both were exceptionally gifted leaders, and each had a special and distinctive work.

The sights I have witnessed in passing to and from Sydney have been heart-sickening. I read in our daily paper that in one locality three thousand sheep were killed daily, and as many as six thousand have been killed in a day. Large canneries are erected, in which the meat is canned, to be sent to Europe. Meat is frozen also, and sent to distant markets."},{"refcode_short":"7MR 421.3","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 7 [Nos. 419-525], p. 421.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"As Brother Belden, my secretary, and myself were returning from the Ashfield campground to our home in Granville, we saw a large herd of cattle in the road ahead of us. One animal, an enormous ox, was standing, sullen and defiant, in the middle of the street in advance of the herd. A man on horseback, having in his hand a danger signal, halted near this animal's head, and called out to Brother Belden, “Keep to the right, and drive as quickly as possible, and he may not make a charge.” We followed directions, and went on our way safely. This poor beast had traveled, oppressed with heat and thirst, until his nature was wrought up to a determined resistance to the will of man, and he had become unmanageable. So it was necessary for a signal flag of danger to be constantly exhibited, as a warning to the people, lest the beast should make a charge upon travelers. In the same herd some animals had been wounded; some were limping along. One poor suffering creature had both horns broken off close to his head, and the blood was flowing from the wound. Some were very lame, and were pictures of brute misery. Taken from the green paddocks, and traveling for weary miles over the hot, dusty road, these poor creatures are driven to their death, that human beings may feast on their miserable dead carcasses."},{"refcode_short":"7MR 422.1","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 7 [Nos. 419-525], p. 422.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I have seen large flocks of sheep, hundreds and even thousands in a flock. Some of these flocks followed the shepherd and seemed to understand where he desired them to go. He had no whip, no dog, as we generally see, but whenever a sheep strayed, he made a peculiar noise with his mouth. Every sheep seemed to understand it, and all pressed close together, following the shepherd. This reminded us of the sheep following the True Shepherd. The affection of animals for man seems to approach so closely to human intelligence that it is a mystery. We need to consider these things. The animals were created by God. They see, they hear, they use their organs as faithfully as human beings use theirs. They are the Lord's creatures. And His word declares, “A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast.” (Proverbs 12:10.)"},{"refcode_short":"7MR 423.1","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 7 [Nos. 419-525], p. 423.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I might fill pages with descriptions of the sights I have seen, the suffering among the animals that are to be used for food. When a sheep in a flock lies down and cannot rise, the others leap over or upon it as they proceed. A large box wagon follows the flock, and I have seen the drivers take up the heavy sheep, when unable to travel farther, and bounce them into the wagon, right upon their backs. And I have counted no less than eight sheep, some already dead, and others in the agonies of death, lying by the roadside, after the flock had passed. But I will not go on to describe these sickening sights. If I had not, prior to this time, discarded the use of the flesh of dead animals, I should now take the pledge to eat no more meat as long as fruits and vegetables can be obtained."},{"refcode_short":"7MR 423.2","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 7 [Nos. 419-525], p. 423.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"We are living in critical times. Disease of every stripe and type is afflicting the human family, and it is largely the result of subsisting upon the diseased flesh of dead animals. Some who have had the consequences of a meat diet set before them do not change. Why? Because they have educated their taste to enjoy the flesh of dead animals, and that taste must be indulged at any cost. And instead of preparing the meat in the least objectionable way, many choose the way that is most objectionable. The meat is served reeking with fat, because it suits the perverted taste. Both the blood and the fat of animals are consumed as a luxury. But the Lord gave special directions that these should not be eaten. Why? Because their use would make a diseased current of blood in the human system. The disregard of the Lord's special directions has brought a variety of difficulties and diseases upon human beings."},{"refcode_short":"7MR 424.1","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 7 [Nos. 419-525], p. 424.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Jesus, speaking from the cloudy pillar, gave special directions to the children of Israel, saying, “It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.” (Leviticus 3:17.) “And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, of sheep, or of goat.” (Leviticus 7:22, 23.) “For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people.
