In November, 1848, Ellen White was given a surprising vision in which she was shown that the church should begin the publication of a small paper. She was instructed that it would be small at first, but that it would eventually become as “streams of light” around the world. Less than a year later, July, 1849, James White issued the first paper titled The Present Truth. The next year, 1850, Present Truth and what was then called The Advent Review merged. This paper has continued to be the official journal of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and is now known as the Adventist Review."},{"refcode_short":"YI, par. 2","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor, paragraph 2","content":"When the Pacific Press Publishing Association was established in 1874 in Oakland, California, James White launched another missionary paper entitled The Signs of the Times.

In August of that year he launched an eight-page monthly titled The Youth's Instructor. The subscription price for twelve issues was 25 cents. The editor wrote on page 2 of that first issue, “We design that the Instructor shall be filled with sensible matter, not only for the benefit of small children, but for the instruction of the youth from 16 to 20 years of age.” This paper then served a wide range of youth for several years."},{"refcode_short":"YI, par. 4","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor, paragraph 4","content":"A four-page weekly issue began January 1, 1879.

Must I dress like her? If it is right for her to dress so, it is right for me. I remembered what the Bible said about adorning the body.

But I knew that I must be plain in my dress. I believed it to be wicked to think so much of appearance, to decorate our poor mortal bodies with flowers and gold.

She was a good and dutiful little girl, and loved her Saviour. She loved to hear of his coming again to take his faithful children to himself. She expected to be alive and remain until the appearing of Jesus, but suddenly her trials here ended, and she was numbered with the sleeping dead, whom God has promised he would bring with him to those mansions he is preparing for those who love him. My little namesake loved the Commandments of God; she loved to do them. Her parents had taught her from her infancy that the first day was not the Sabbath of the Lord, and referred her to the fourth commandment of the Decalogue: “But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.” Ellen loved the Sabbath, loved to keep it holy, and with her parents whom she loved and honored was ready to make any sacrifice rather than desecrate the day which the Lord has blessed, and called holy and honorable."},{"refcode_short":"YI April 1,  1859, par. 2","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor April 1,  1859, paragraph 2","content":"We loved Ellen, for she was ever gentle, kind and affectionate.

Listen to the words of Jesus. “Blessed are they that do his (the Father's) Commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and enter in through the gates into the city” It is enough.

Don't be discouraged if you do fail at first. If the tongue goes in its wonted course a few times when you are not on your guard, do not give up the battle.

They were convicted that their expectations in regard to the object and manner of Christ's appearing was not in accordance with prophecy; but they were not willing to give up the theories which had met their minds and called forth their proud boast to their enemies of the riches and glory of their coming King. They were not willing to admit that they had been deceived. Pride and unbelief led them to refuse to accept the light which convicted their understanding.

These ambitious desires originated with Satan, and are the ruling principles in his character; and through the fall, and through the influence of his continued temptations, men have become like him in character, in motives, and pursuits.

When held up before the light of God's word, the character is found to be like the moth-eaten garment, which, when shaken out and examined, reveals the destructive work that has been going on secretly for years. While they have a form of godliness, sins small in their eyes have been eating into the warp and woof of their character; and that which at a casual glance appeared lovely, is unsightly and disgusting to look upon. Could the actor, as he entered upon this path of wrong, have seen himself as he appeared when his true character was opened to the light, he would have been as terrified and startled as was Hazael when Elisha told him what a wicked and cruel course he would pursue in the future.

It took time for the moth to do its work of destruction so quietly in the dark; and it takes time, little by little, for a child or youth to be easy and happy and feel secure in a course of prevarication, a course of sin hidden from human eyes. Any one act, either good or evil, does not form the character, but thoughts and feelings indulged, prepare the way for acts and deeds of the same kind. A single glass of wine may lead to the formation of a habit most difficult to overcome, and is the first step which may lead to dishonesty, theft, and murder. What you do once, children and youth, you will do more readily the second time. It is the starting in any wrong course that must be guarded against.

We must not pick and choose the work most agreeable to us; for we are Christ's soldiers, under his discipline, and we are not to study our own pleasure.

The mind is filled with a cheap kind of food for meditation, so that it becomes powerless to search and comprehend the very things which concern eternal interests. The Lord enjoins upon children and youth to search for truth as for hidden treasure, and to be attracted and fascinated by that which unites the human with the divine. Story books are read with assiduity; fictitious tales are eagerly devoured; and a large class, not only of children and youth, but of men and women of mature age, are mental inebriates. They seem more or less indifferent upon religious matters, for their moral taste is perverted; and as they give their mind cheap food, it becomes enfeebled, just as the body becomes weak when deprived of healthful nourishment. As the mind becomes habituated to contemplate subjects which do not draw upon its powers, the sensibilities of the mind become dwarfed, and grow cold and unimpressible. The mind then has no appetite for serious and divine contemplation, and takes no interest in the study of the deep, hidden truths of God's word. There is need for penetrating minds to dig for the truth as for hidden treasure. The mind that is allowed to read story books and novels, will not be interested in searching the Scriptures.

Well may the apostle ask, “How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?” Our youth should be presented with a pledge to sign that they will not touch idle tales, but that they will make diligent search of the Scriptures, that they will give their minds the most nourishing, wholesome food, in order to become strong in contemplating the works of Christ who became surety for the fallen race."},{"refcode_short":"YI August 31,  1887, par. 8","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor August 31,  1887, paragraph 8","content":"The power of an angel could not make an atonement for our sins. The angelic nature united to the human could not be as costly, as elevated, as the law of God. It was the Son of God alone who could present an acceptable sacrifice. God himself became man, and bore all the wrath that sin had provoked. This problem, How could God be just and yet the justifier of sinners? baffled all finite intelligence. A divine person alone could mediate between God and man. Human redemption is a theme which may well tax the faculties of the mind to the utmost. The reason that Christianity is not more elevated is because there is so little effort put forth in the great, grand, holy work of struggling for immortality. Satan is constantly trying to make the salvation of the soul an indifferent matter,—that man has but little to do to secure this priceless treasure. This is why eternal things are not discerned; this is why there is a cheap, spurious article passed off as religion. There are many who say, “I am saved; I am sanctified; I have nothing to do, Jesus has done it all,” and they care not to search the Scriptures or to hear the voice of God in his word, or to be doers of the word. This belief is like a building erected on sliding sand. It is a refuge of lies, and the storm and tempest sweep it away, and “great,” says Christ, “is the fall of it;” because the false hopes were built so high, and the builder felt so perfectly secure. It was a delusive hope. Our faith, the hope we claim of one day obtaining immortality, calls for the stretch of every muscle, and the strain of every nerve. We cannot be saved in sin and in transgression of God's law. We cannot be saved in indolence and inactivity. We must search the Scriptures if we would have spiritual enlightenment. We have to wrestle against pride and against the human passions, which the light of God's word reveals.

And though the path is obstructed through existing inclination, he must press, he must urge his way; he must abase his will, his desires; he must feel his helplessness, his nothingness, and look alone to the Author and finisher of his faith. It is noble to seek repentance and salvation through the merits of Jesus Christ. We cannot say to the youth or those of mature age, You have nothing to do yourself in this great work. We urge to constant effort. You must be diligent to make your calling and election sure, else you will be found without God and without hope. The youth must become intelligent in the Scriptures; they may, if sanctified through the truth, become living channels of light, and they must strive for the mastery. There will be a work done in the hearts by the Spirit of God, a change wrought in the character. “I thought on my ways, and turned my feet to Thy Testimonies.” The great danger with many of our youth is, they do not study the Scriptures and meditate, like David, upon His testimonies. So far as eternity is concerned, they seldom think of it. If they will make the Scriptures the subject of careful study, they will make it a subject of meditation. Once make them anxious for their souls, and they will labor to be saved; and when this point is reached, angels in heaven sweep their harps in exultation that a soul is saved."},{"refcode_short":"YI June 23,  1892","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor June 23,  1892","content":"1892"},{"refcode_short":"YI June 23,  1892","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor June 23,  1892","content":"June 23, 1892"},{"refcode_short":"YI June 23,  1892","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor June 23,  1892","content":"Words for the Young"},{"refcode_short":"YI June 23,  1892, par. 1","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor June 23,  1892, paragraph 1","content":"The coming of Christ to our world was a great event, not only to this world, but to all the worlds in the universe of God.

And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one; I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them as thou hast loved me.”"},{"refcode_short":"YI December 8,  1892, par. 3","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor December 8,  1892, paragraph 3","content":"“The glory which thou gavest me, I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one.” This glory is the character of Christ, and through his righteousness, what a prospect is opened before the children of God!

In the prayer of Christ the relation of the believer to Christ is plainly revealed as one most tender and abiding.

The rainbow encircling his throne is a pledge of his covenant of love. All heavenly gifts come to us through the work redemption has wrought, and the graces of his Spirit, the pledge of his word, are but the streams of life that flow from the fountain of his love. “Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and [because he loved us] sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins,” and “not for ours only, but for the sins of the whole world.”"},{"refcode_short":"YI December 8,  1892, par. 4","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor December 8,  1892, paragraph 4","content":"Through the wonderful condescension of God in our behalf, we are entitled to peculiar dignity and honor.

They should ever keep the fact before their eyes that they have been bought with a price, and should glorify God in their bodies and spirits, which are his. The youth should seriously consider what shall be their purpose and life work, and lay the foundation in such a way that their habits shall be free from all taint of corruption. If they would stand in a position where they shall influence others, they must be self-reliant.

They should shun the society of those who are absorbing every evil influence, who are inactive and without earnest desire for attainment of a high standard of character, who cannot be relied upon as persons who will be true to principle. Let the youth be found in association with those who fear and love God; for these noble, firm characters are represented by the lily that opens its pure blossom on the bosom of the lake. They refuse to be molded by the influences that would demoralize, and gather to themselves only that which will aid the development of a pure and noble character.

You once avowed yourselves to be the Lord's, and the sweet peace of Jesus pervaded the soul. You did taste, and testified that the Lord is good. But you did not follow the requirements of God. You failed to live up to the light; yet Jesus loves you still. Come and seek the Lord just as you are, and do not be discouraged and think you are forsaken of God and man.

His life and character were the unfolding or representation of the perfection of the character that man may attain by becoming a partaker of the divine nature and overcoming the world through daily conflicts.

Satan is employed in devising specious allurements; and by transgression in what seem little matters, he draws you away from Jesus. Then larger attractions are presented to seduce you fully from God. You may have your name upon the church books, and claim to be a child of God, yet your example, your influence, misrepresents the character of Christ, and you lead others away from Jesus. There is no happiness, no peace or joy to a professed believer, whose whole soul is not enlisted in the work the Lord has given him to do. He is constantly bringing the world into the church, not by repentance and confession and surrender to God, but by surrendering more and more to the world, and engaging on Satan's side in the battle, rather than on Christ's side.

It is safe for you to be just where Christ has said he would be. Those who appreciate the words of Christ will not turn aside from the prayer-meeting, or from the meeting where the Lord's messenger has been sent to tell you concerning things of eternal interest. Jesus has said, “Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.” Can you afford to choose your pleasure and miss the blessing? It is indulgence in these things that has a telling influence not only on your own life and character, but upon the life and character of your associates. If all who profess to be followers of Christ would be so in deed and in truth, they would have the mind of Christ, and would work the works of God. They would resist temptation to indulge self and would show that they do not enjoy the frivolous pleasure of the world more than the privilege of meeting with Christ in the social meeting. They would then have a decided influence upon others and lead them to follow their example. Actions speak louder than words, and those who are lovers of pleasure do not appreciate the rich blessings of being in the assembly of the people of God. They do not appreciate the privilege of influencing their associates to go with them, hoping that their hearts will be touched by the Spirit of the Lord. Who goes with them into these worldly gatherings? Jesus is not there to bless those assembled. But Satan will bring to the mind many things to crowd out matters of eternal interest. It is his opportunity to confuse the right by mixing it up with wrong. Through attendance at worldly gatherings a taste is created for exciting amusements, and moral power is weakened. Those who love pleasure may keep up a form of godliness, but they have no vital connection with God. Their faith is dead, their zeal has departed.

But this light has been provided for every soul, and it is only as we withdraw from the light that darkness comes upon us. Jesus said, “He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.” In the world about us there can be no life without light. Were the sun to withdraw his shining, all vegetation, all animal life, would have an end. This illustrates the fact that we cannot have spiritual life unless we place ourselves under the beams of the Sun of righteousness. If we put a flowering plant in a dark room, it will soon wither and die; and so we may have some spiritual life, and yet lose it by dwelling in an atmosphere of doubt and gloom. Jesus says, “Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye except ye abide in me.

We should not narrow our circle of friends to a few favorites because they pet and flatter us by their professed affection. The partial attention so often bestowed and received, works not for the highest good of those who would serve God. One draws upon the other for strength, and the praise, flattery, and affection one receives of the other, supplies the place that should be supplied by the grace of God, and thus human friends take the affections from Christ.

Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt. But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellow-servants, which owed him a hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest. And his fellow-servant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt. So when his fellow-servants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done. Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredest me: shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow-servant, even as I had pity on thee?

In refusing to render service to God, you rob him of the service which is his due, and you are accountable for the work that you should do as a faithful soldier of Christ. God is dishonored by your resistance against his love, and the church is dishonored in that you have had opportunities, and have stood in stubborn rebellion against God, and by this have led other souls astray. You have refused to become a vessel meet for the Master's use, to communicate blessing to those who are ready to perish. Those who venture to neglect the great salvation that has been provided for them, are responsible for the consequences and results of their influence; are accountable for what might have been done had they cooperated with the heavenly agencies which God provided for their help. Christ has suffered and died to bring salvation within the reach of all, and how can we refuse to be obedient? How can we refuse to be qualified for the work that will bring blessing to our own soul, and to the souls of others?"},{"refcode_short":"YI June 22,  1893","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor June 22,  1893","content":"June 22, 1893"},{"refcode_short":"YI June 22,  1893","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor June 22,  1893","content":"Words to the Young"},{"refcode_short":"YI June 22,  1893, par. 1","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor June 22,  1893, paragraph 1","content":"“No man liveth unto himself.” It is impossible for any of us to live in such a way that we shall not cast an influence in the world.

In this way, a taste has been created for exciting pleasure, and children and youth have trained their minds so that they delight in exciting displays; and they have a positive dislike for the sober, useful duties of life. They live lives more after the order of the brute creation. They have no thoughts of God, or of eternal realities; but flit like butterflies in their season. They do not act like sensible beings, whose life is capable of measuring with the life of God, and who are accountable to him for every hour of their time. What assurance has any child or youth that even one day of life may be his? Children and youth die, and they know not how soon their probation will close, and their destiny be fixed for eternal life or everlasting death. Let children and youth take Christ for their example, be subject unto their parents, and improve their time, knowing that Christ, who died for them, is looking upon them, to bestow his approval upon those who follow in his footsteps. Let them so live, through the merits of the grace of Christ, that he may say of them at last, “They shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.”"},{"refcode_short":"YI July 27,  1893","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor July 27,  1893","content":"July 27, 1893"},{"refcode_short":"YI July 27,  1893","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor July 27,  1893","content":"Words to the Young"},{"refcode_short":"YI July 27,  1893, par. 1","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor July 27,  1893, paragraph 1","content":"Of the child Jesus it is written, “And the Child grew, and waxed strong in the spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon him.” “Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.” The physical constitution of Jesus, as well as his spiritual development, is brought before us in these words, “the child grew,” and “increased in stature.” In childhood and youth attention should be given to physical development. Parents should so train their children in good habits of eating, drinking, dressing, and exercise, that a good foundation will be laid for sound health in after life.

For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.” “Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; but the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.” “When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.

Jesus was “wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.” Is it possible to be healed, while knowingly committing sin?—No; it is genuine faith that says, I know that I have committed sin, but that Jesus has pardoned my sin; and hereafter I will resist temptation in and through his might. “Every man that hath this hope in him [abiding in him] purifieth himself, even as he is pure.” He has an abiding principle in the soul, that enables him to overcome temptation. “Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not.” God has power to keep the soul who is in Christ, when that soul is under temptation. “Whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.” That is, every one who is a true believer is sanctified through the truth, in life and character. “Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth [not professeth to do] righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.” “Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; ... because he is born of God. In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil.” Now mark where the distinction is made: “Whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither is he that loveth not his brother.” “My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth.”"},{"refcode_short":"YI March 1,  1894","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor March 1,  1894","content":"March 1, 1894"},{"refcode_short":"YI March 1,  1894","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor March 1,  1894","content":"Make the Vessel Pure Within"},{"refcode_short":"YI March 1,  1894, par. 1","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor March 1,  1894, paragraph 1","content":"Unless the mind of God becomes the mind of men, every effort of man to purify himself will be useless; for it is impossible to elevate man except through a knowledge of God.

But all the deformity of soul is open to him who judgeth righteously, and unless the truth is planted in the heart, it cannot control the life. Cleansing the outside of the cup will never make the vessel pure within. A nominal acceptance of truth is good as far as it goes, and the ability to give a reason for our faith is a good accomplishment; but if the truth does not go deeper than this, the soul will never be saved.

The law of God is to be written in the heart, or the soul will never obey the truth; for the truth of God may be no truth to one who may even claim to believe it.

Why is it that the love of Christ does not wield a constraining power over the life?—It is because it has never been brought into the sanctuary of the soul; it has never been made the principle of action. “With the heart, man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation.”"},{"refcode_short":"YI March 1,  1894, par. 3","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor March 1,  1894, paragraph 3","content":"Unless the truth is stamped upon the soul, it will not be obeyed in the life.

God permits him to be attacked by the enemy, in order that he may understand his own weakness. He is permitted to make some decided blunder, and is plunged into painful humiliation. But when he is writhing under a sense of his own weakness, he is not to be judged harshly. This is the time above all others when he needs a judicious counselor, a true friend, who has discernment of character. This is the time when he needs a friend who is led by the Spirit of God, and who will deal patiently and faithfully with the erring, and lift up the soul that is bowed down. He is not to be lifted up by the aid of flattery. No one is authorized to deal out to the soul this delusive intoxicant of Satan. Rather he is to be pointed to the first rounds of the ladder, and his stumbling feet are to be placed on the lowest round of the ladder of progress.

We shall be held accountable for doing our duty to God and to our fellow-men. Our false theories of life will not lessen the claims that are upon us, or make void the relation that exists between us and humanity. We cannot break the thread of our obligation to others.

His purity and holiness of character were a constant rebuke to those who deceived the people with their pretentious claims of superior righteousness. He knew the wickedness of the sanctimonious religious teachers, and said to his disciples: “Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.” He was betrayed by one of his disciples, who opened his heart to the suggestions of the enemy, when Christ reproved him. Satan works in the same way upon human agents in our day. When sinners are reproved, the enmity of their wicked hearts is stirred into intense hatred against the reprover. Christ's stainless life was a rebuke to the world, and the world hated him. He died a most shameful death, and made a full and complete sacrifice, in order that no one might perish, but that all might come to repentance. He made an atonement for every repenting, believing soul, in order that all might find in him a sin-bearer. If those who believe in him will but practise his words, which are spirit and life; if they will follow his example, and become a precious light to the world, they will do that for the world which no human philosophy can accomplish.

He was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. His whole life was one of self-denial, expressing the prayer, “Not my will, but thine, O God, be done.” Christ is our pattern, and those who follow Christ will not walk in darkness; for they will not seek their own pleasure. To glorify God will be the continual aim of their life. Christ represented the character of God to the world. The Lord Jesus so conducted his life that men were compelled to acknowledge that he had done all things well. The world's Redeemer was the light of the world; for his character was without fault.

Men and women who have been blessed with an abundance of money, with houses and with lands, generally train their children to a life of idleness and selfish indulgence. Thus they are made useless for this life, and unfit for the future, immortal life. Christ in his life gave men an altogether different example. In his youth he worked with his father at the carpenter's trade; but the youth of today are educated to believe that it is the money that makes the man. The sure result of such education is seen in the pride, the vanity, the love of pleasure, the sinful practices, that are so prevalent in this degenerate age. Where there is an abundance of idleness, Satan works with his temptations to spoil life and character. If youth are not trained to useful labor, whether they be rich or poor, they are in peril; for Satan will find them employment after his own order. The youth who are not barricaded with principle, do not regard time as a precious treasure, a trust from God for which every human being must give an account.

The law of kindness was in his lips, and there was no guile in his mouth.

These poor souls will not be strong in God until they accept Christ as a complete Saviour. They can add nothing to their salvation. The Israelites were required to sprinkle the door-posts with the blood of a slain lamb, in order that when the angel of death passed through the land, they might escape destruction. But if instead of doing this simple act of faith and obedience, they had barricaded the door, and taken every precaution to keep the destroying angel out, their pains would have been in vain, and would have testified to their unbelief.

They must take steps themselves in order to find Christ a mediator in their behalf. It is true that there must be repentance before there is pardon; but the sinner must come to Christ before he can find repentance. It is the virtue of Christ that strengthens and enlightens the soul, so, that repentance may be godly and acceptable. Peter has made this matter clear where he says of Christ, “Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.” Repentance is as certainly a gift of Jesus Christ as is forgiveness of sins. Repentance cannot be experienced without Christ; for it is the repentance of which he is the author that is the ground upon which we may apply for pardon. It is through the work of the Holy Spirit that men are led to repentance. It is from Christ that the grace of contrition comes, as well as the gift of pardon, and repentance as well as forgiveness of sins is procured only through the atoning blood of Christ.

Those who shall inhabit those mansions must be fitted for the society of heaven by the righteousness of Christ, and by the work of the Holy Spirit. The preparation for heaven must be made in probationary time, and there must now be submission to the work of the Spirit of God on the heart, in order that the soul may be brought into communication with heaven, and may be educated to enjoy the realities of the eternal world.

The Lord has set before the world an open door, and no man can shut it. God so loved the world, that having given his Son, who was equal with himself, he could not withhold heaven itself.

Christ says: “The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.” When we utter meaningless and silly words, we encourage others to indulge in the same kind of conversation; but it is a great sin in the sight of God to allow ourselves to utter words that do not suggest pure, choice thoughts which will elevate, ennoble, and sanctify our characters and the characters of those who hear. The only words that come from our lips should be pure, clean words. No one can tell how much sin is created by careless, foolish, unmeaning words. The character of those who utter these senseless words is indexed by them.

In speaking foolish words, you have dishonored the name of Christ; for you have misrepresented him in character. No word of guile was found in his lips, no word of prevarication or falsehood. The people that are described as making up the one hundred and forty-four thousand, have the Father's name written in their foreheads, and of them it is said: “In their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.” If they had been speaking foolish, senseless, false words, they would not have been found without guile, and without fault before the throne of God. John also wrote, saying: “After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb. And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshiped God, saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever, Amen. And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.”"},{"refcode_short":"YI June 27,  1895, par. 5","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor June 27,  1895, paragraph 5","content":"O that all our youth would form characters after the divine similitude!

At times when he was upon earth, divinity flashed through humanity, and his true character was revealed. The God of heaven testified to his oneness with his Son. At his baptism the heavens were opened, and the glory of God in the similitude of a dove like burnished gold hovered over the Saviour, and a voice came from heaven, saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” But the nation to whom Christ came, though professing to be the peculiar people of God, did not recognize the heavenly treasure in the person of Jesus Christ.

He said again: “The kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant-man, seeking goodly pearls: who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.” This goodly pearl represents the priceless treasure of Christ, as does the gold hid in the field. In Christ we have everything that is needful for us in this life, and that which will make up the joy of the world to come. All the money in the world will not buy the gift of peace and rest and love. These gifts are provided for us through faith in Christ. We cannot purchase these gifts from God; we have nothing with which to buy them. We are the property of God; for mind, soul, and body have been purchased by the ransom of the life of the Son of God. Then how can we buy the Son of God as our treasure?

It is cooperation with God; it is bearing the yoke with Christ; it is lifting his burdens. For our sakes he became poor, that we through his poverty might be made rich. The Lord Jesus laid aside his royal crown, he left his high command, he clothed his divinity with humanity, in order that through humanity he might uplift the human race. He so appreciated the possibility of the human race that he became man's substitute and surety. He places upon man his own merit, and thus elevates him in the scale of moral value with God. Christ is the atoning sacrifice. He left the glory of heaven, he parted with his riches, he laid aside his honor, not in order to create love and interest for man in the heart of God, but to be an exponent of the love that existed in the heart of the Father. He came into the world to make man accept the fact that although man had sinned against God, “God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” Jesus paid the price of all his riches, he assumed humanity, he condescended to a life of poverty and humiliation, in order that he might seek and save that which was lost."},{"refcode_short":"YI September 5,  1895, par. 2","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor September 5,  1895, paragraph 2","content":"Through the grace of Christ, we may be strengthened and matured, so that though now imperfect, we may become complete in him.

But they will also realize the fulfilment of the promise: “Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.” We need to receive divine wisdom in the daily concerns of life, in order that we may display sound judgment, and choose the safe path because it is the right one. He who acts upon his own judgment will follow the inclination of the natural heart; but he whose mind is opened to the word of God, will prayerfully consider every way of his feet, so that he may honor God, and keep the way of the Lord. He will remember that “even Christ pleased not himself,” and he will consider it a great privilege to follow in His steps. He will take his perplexities to God in prayer, and ask the guidance of him whose property he is. He will realize that he belongs to God, soul, body, mind, and strength.

Yielding to the solicitations of evil, you have experienced evil as did Adam when he fell into the snare; but those who through faith are kept by the power of God, learn good and precious things. They experience the peace of Christ which passeth understanding. In resisting temptation, you refuse to be confederate with Satan, and place yourselves under the banner of Jesus Christ. In the sight of heavenly intelligences, you develop yourself as a conqueror. It is made manifest that you are a son of God. “As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: which were born, not of blood, not of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.” You represent Christ in true goodness of character, and understand what these words signify, “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth....

Unless they become vitally connected with God, they can never resist the unhallowed effects of self-love and self-indulgence and temptation to sin. If they were soundly converted to God, they would experience the love that dwells in the heart of Jesus; and under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, it would well up like an irrepressible stream, refreshing their own sterile lives, and refreshing all those who are connected with them. I long to address the young men and women who are so willing to reach only cheap standards. O that the Lord might influence their minds to see what perfection of character is!

His parents also listened in amazement, as they heard his searching questions. Jesus knew that God had given him this opportunity to give light to those who were in darkness, and he sought to do all in his power to open the truth to the rabbis and teachers. He led these men to speak about different verses in the Bible telling about the Messiah whom they expected to come. They thought that Christ was to come to the world in great glory at this time, and make the Jewish nation the greatest nation on the earth.

They were looking for the glory that will be seen when Christ comes the second time, and did not study the Bible so that they could know that he was to come the first time in a very lowly way.

He taught them by his words and by his example that the future would be decided by the way in which they spent the present. Our destiny is marked out by our own course of action. Those who cherish that which is right, who work out God's plan though it be in a narrow sphere of action, and who do right because it is right, will find wider fields of usefulness.

There is grace with God to enable you to serve him just where you are, and excuses of this order have no weight with him. Do not charge your circumstances with your failure. The Lord knows where you are, and he would have you practise those things which make for godliness. You need not be an element of strife, no matter what arises to try to vex you. You may be a peacemaker, whatever may be your circumstances.

Where there are peacemakers, there is the ministry of holy angels. Be converted; repent; realize what religion is. Open your hearts, and let the Lord Jesus in. We cannot be half-hearted in the service of God, and be prepared to stand in the judgment.

Character is not transferable. It is not to be bought or sold; it is to be acquired. The Lord has given to every individual an opportunity to obtain a righteous character through the hours of probation; but he has not provided a way by which one human agent may impart to another the character which he has developed by going through hard experiences, by learning lessons from the great Teacher, so that he can manifest patience under trial, and exercise faith so that he can remove mountains of impossibility.

All heaven rejoices at the redemption of the lost race. Christ rejoiced in the secret consciousness of what he purposed to do for man. He desires to do far more abundantly than we are able to ask or think. The fountain of his inexpressible love is inexhaustible, and it flows toward all those who believe in him, who are willing to practise self-denial and to suffer reproach for his name. When we submit to truth, we submit to its Author. The Holy Spirit works within us, casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and brings into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. Through sin the heart and the mind have been defiled and enfeebled, but Jesus came to impart moral power, to reshape moral taste, to fashion man after the divine similitude, and to elevate humanity in the scale of moral value with God. If we would learn of Christ, we must have the faith which works by love and purifies the soul. Faith is valueless if it does not work by love and expel from the soul all selfishness, all pride and self-righteousness. Assent to the truth will never win heaven; but those who tremble at the word of the Lord, who desire to know and do his will, will not be disappointed in their hope of heaven.

She needs some one beside her; for she has not breadth of mind enough to comprehend the situation, to understand how one thing after another should be done, nor to use tact in her housekeeping.” I was warned against employing another because, while everything was in disorder, she would sit down in the midst of her unfinished work, and with newspaper or book in hand, forget all about her duties. Of still another who I thought would please me, I learned that she was untidy. Another was disrespectful. For persons to whom she took a violent fancy, she would show great consideration, going to any lengths in order to receive their approbation and flattery. But she had no reverence or even respect for any one else. “But,” I reasoned, “if she is a Christian, she will surely take counsel.” An expression of sorrow came over the countenance of my friend as she replied: “I am afraid you will be disappointed in her. If you insist upon having things done as you wish, if you plainly set before her the mistakes she is making, instead of correcting them, she will say that she does the best she can, and will take upon her the air of one who has been much injured. She does not respect those in authority, but will have a sneer in her mind, which, if not revealed to you in words, will be manifest in her expression.

To every one who names the name of Christ, who has decided to follow the meek and lowly Jesus, just as truly as to the Jewish ruler, these words are addressed, “Ye must be born again.” If they are received and heeded, they will be as a light shining in a dark place, guiding the inquiring soul into perfect day."},{"refcode_short":"YI September 9,  1897","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor September 9,  1897","content":"September 9, 1897"},{"refcode_short":"YI September 9,  1897","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor September 9,  1897","content":"“Ye Must Be Born Again”"},{"refcode_short":"YI September 9,  1897, par. 1","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor September 9,  1897, paragraph 1","content":"As God's purchased possession, we are under contract to work as Christ worked in his divine service, not in accordance with our natural inclinations, but in harmony with the Spirit of God.

Its length, its breadth, its depth, its height, cannot be estimated. It will purify your heart and renew your mind, giving you a new capacity for knowing and loving God. Do not let self hinder you from hearing the call, “Ye must be born again.” Fear not to make a full surrender of yourself to Christ. Place yourself, without reserve, under his control.

The consequence of sin, as seen on the cross of Calvary, would break a heart of stone, did the sinner but contemplate the scene. It is in this contemplation that a hatred of sin is born in the heart, and the Holy Spirit works at the same time to inspire hope through the plan of salvation. How much easier would it seem to the human mind for God to have destroyed out of the world the creatures he had made, and so put an end to sin! But the Lord chose the costlier plan. He gave his Son for the sins of the world; for though he hates sin, he loves the sinner. “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” The gift of Christ to the world shows the exalted character of the plan of salvation.

Those who profess to love Christ, and yet have no love for those for whom Christ died, make it manifest that Christ does not abide in their hearts. Those who love Jesus will be willing to deny themselves, to make sacrifices, and, if need be, to suffer temporal loss, that by earnest effort, by fervent prayer, by the use of every ability, they may win souls to the truth. This is the character of the love that should be brought into our experiences, which will work to overcome the selfishness characteristic of the natural heart. If we were indeed partakers of the divine nature, much more of the love of Christ would be revealed, and we would exert a softening, subduing, refining influence upon those around us.

Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.” The confession of which John here speaks, is not the result of a nominal faith, but is the result of an abiding faith in the living Saviour,—the result of believing that the blessings of salvation are brought within our reach through the sufferings and death of Christ, who was raised from the dead, and ever liveth to make intercession for us. We should feel assured that Jesus is our Saviour, and that life would not be enjoyable, nor afford us peace or hope, if he had not loved us and given himself for us.

Jesus gave to men a perfect example of what they should do and be. He was meek and lowly of heart. He made himself of no reputation, but came into close sympathy with the sorrows and griefs and woes of the people. Those who follow Christ in his humiliation and suffering are partakers of the divine nature. They make no claims to goodness, they accept self-denial and the cross as their portion from the Lord. “As he is, so are we in this world.” O what love, what self-sacrificing love, has been manifested by the Son of God in giving such exalted privileges to those whom he came to save! The tender mercies of God are unmeasured, and those who appreciate the love of Christ will be renewed in true holiness, and brought unto Christ, their living Head. They will be followers of God as dear children. They will love their brethren, and feel a tender anxiety for those who are perishing out of Christ. They will not selfishly retain the precious knowledge of the truth, but will labor to convert sinners from the error of their ways. This labor of love will bring them into close sympathy with Jesus, and will be the inspiration of their prayers, and will give them boldness in the day of judgment.

God has resources of power of which we as yet know nothing, and from these he will supply us in our time of need. But our effort is ever to combine with the divine. Our intellect, our perceptive powers, all the strength of our being, must be called into exercise. We must co-operate with God in this work of salvation.

The disciple John writes: “I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.

The prophecy made in Eden was fulfilled, “I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.” Christ was nailed to the cross, but he gained the victory. The whole force of evil gathered itself together in an effort to destroy him who was the Light of the world, the Truth that makes men wise unto salvation. But no advantage was gained by this confederacy. With every advance move, Satan was bringing nearer his eternal ruin. Christ was indeed enduring the contradiction of sinners against himself. But every pang of suffering that he bore helped tear away the foundation of the enemy's kingdom. Satan bruised Christ's heel, but Christ bruised Satan's head. Through death the Saviour destroyed him that had the power of death. In the very act of grasping his prey, death was vanquished; for by dying, Christ brought to light life and immortality through the gospel. Never was the Son of God more beloved by his Father, by the heavenly family, and by the inhabitants of the unfallen worlds, than when he humbled himself to bear disgrace, humiliation, shame, and abuse.

They purposed to remove Lazarus secretly, and thus less publicity would be given to the death of Christ. They could bring no charge against Lazarus; but rather than admit evidence that could not denied, they plotted to kill him. The end, they argued, would justify the means.

If your motives are pure and unselfish, if you are ever looking for work to do, if you are always on the alert to show kindly attentions and do courteous deeds, you are unconsciously building your own monument. This is the work God calls upon all children and youth to do. Do good, if you would be cherished in the memory of others. Live to be a blessing to all with whom you come in contact, wherever your lot may be cast. Let the children and youth awake to their opportunities. By kindness and love, by self-sacrificing deeds, let them write their names in the hearts of those with whom they associate."},{"refcode_short":"YI February 14,  1901","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor February 14,  1901","content":"February 14, 1901"},{"refcode_short":"YI February 14,  1901","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor February 14,  1901","content":"Ministering Spirits"},{"refcode_short":"YI February 14,  1901, par. 1","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor February 14,  1901, paragraph 1","content":"God has recorded many narratives in his inspired word to teach us that the human family is the object of the special care of heavenly angels.

Those who prayerfully study the Bible go from each search wiser than they were before. Some of their difficulties have been solved; for the Holy Spirit has done the work spoken of in the fourteenth chapter of John: “The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.”"},{"refcode_short":"YI July 24,  1902, par. 6","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor July 24,  1902, paragraph 6","content":"Nothing worth having is obtained without earnest, persevering effort.

If you do not realize that he is yours, by all means make him yours. Then without delay teach others what you have experienced in the Christian life. Instead of being as frail reeds blowing in the wind, show yourselves as those who have root in themselves—that you believe and that you practise the truth, and its sanctifying power is upon your life and character. Then you will be walking in the light while you have the light. Will the young men and young women who really love Jesus organize themselves as workers, not only for those who profess to be Sabbath-keepers, but for those who are not of our faith; for there is no respect of persons with God?

Many outside of the ranks of Sabbath-keepers, who have not had the light, give more promise of becoming children of God, joint heirs with Jesus, than do those who have had the light of truth, and who have not appreciated it, but have walked in the sparks of their own kindling. No one can labor successfully for souls without true, earnest, unselfish interest. Those who do so labor will see souls converted, and will themselves grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

Instead of being half-hearted reformers, let them make a whole-hearted reformation, in all things practising chastity and temperance. Let none begin to reform, and then stop. Resolve to overcome the wicked one. True victory is gained only when the repentant sinner pledges himself to unconditional obedience to God,—only when he pledges himself to honor God in every word, every business transaction, every act of his life. Those who do this may be like the youth whom John addressed in the words: “I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.” It is possible for every youth to gain spiritual strength. Those who endeavor to increase their strength will pass through severe struggles, which will test their sincerity of purpose; but by remaining faithful, they prove that their determination to do God's will is prompted by high and holy motives.

From the oldest to the youngest, you do need to be particular to avoid evil, even the appearance of evil. It is possible for the youth to be such earnest Christians that through them the Lord will send the truth home to those who have never known him."},{"refcode_short":"YI June 9,  1914, par. 7","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor June 9,  1914, paragraph 7","content":"I was very young when I began to serve the Lord. I am now eighty-five years old. In my childhood affliction came to me, and I have been a sufferer all my life. But the Lord has been my strength to do his service, and I have been able to speak again and again to congregations numbering thousands of people. For a great many years I have been engaged in active labor, speaking to the people and writing out the instruction opened before me. At times sickness has come upon me, and then I would cast my helpless soul upon Jesus Christ, and say: “Thou knowest, Lord, that I have chosen thee as my Redeemer. Give me not only spiritual strength, but physical strength, that I may follow on to know thee.” And the Lord has never forsaken me. Always he has been my helper, as he will be yours if you will trust in him. It is because I so greatly desire to work for the salvation of souls that I do not give up to infirmities. I am determined that as long as God permits me to live, I will proclaim the message of warning to the world. I want my voice to reach many more before I shall give up my labors. I expect to have trials, but I do not dread them. The Lord knows what I can bear, and he will give me strength to endure. He will sustain me in my weakness, enabling me to follow on, and to know that his going forth is prepared as the morning."},{"refcode_short":"YI June 9,  1914, par. 8","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor June 9,  1914, paragraph 8","content":"Students, be determined that you will follow on to know the Lord. Remember that angels are beside you. They see all your efforts against wrong. They understand all your difficulties; and if in meekness you will give up your own way for Christ's way, taking his yoke cheerfully, you will find that he will give you daily strength to overcome. As I see you all here, the thought comes to me, Shall I meet them in the kingdom of heaven? What a meeting that will be when the redeemed are gathered home, saved, eternally saved. They have fought the good fight. They have pressed the battle to the gates. They have done all in their power to help others to follow in the Saviour's footsteps."},{"refcode_short":"YI June 9,  1914, par. 9","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor June 9,  1914, paragraph 9","content":"I know that there are many here who are trying to overcome through the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony. I want to say to you, Jesus wants every one of you. He died that you and I might be among those who shall wear the crown of life. He wants you, from the oldest to the youngest, to place your influence on his side. He wants your help. I pray that those who today have listened to me will lay hold upon the hope set before them in the gospel. I pray that in the great day of Christ's coming, their voices will help to swell the song of joy and triumph that will be raised by the overcomers. I beg of you, dear youth, to link up with Jesus Christ. He died on Calvary's cross for you and for me, and in his strength we may overcome."},{"refcode_short":"YI June 9,  1914, par. 10","refcode_long":"The Youth’s Instructor June 9,  1914, paragraph 10","content":"Follow on to know the Lord. If you will do this, you will win souls to Christ. Not only will your own soul be saved; the power that converts your soul will enable you to set an example that will win others to Christ. These older children can be an example to the younger ones, leading and guiding them aright, speaking a word in season to them. Thus you can be laborers together with God. I want to say to these boys, You can overcome evil—evil thoughts, evil desires—by the blood of the Lamb and the word of your testimony. We cannot afford to sin. It costs too much. May the Lord bless you all. We shall think of you and pray for you. I want to offer a word of prayer now."}]
