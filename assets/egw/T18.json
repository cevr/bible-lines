Whatever we do, we are to bear the consequences ourselves.” Dear friends, you are greatly mistaken. You are not the only sufferers from a wrong course. The society you are in bears the consequences of your wrongs, in a great degree, as well as yourselves. If you are suffering from your intemperance in eating or in drinking, we that are around you, or associated with you, are affected by your infirmities. We have to suffer on account of the course you pursue, which is wrong. If it has an influence to lessen your powers of mind or body, we are affected by it. We have to feel it. When in your society, instead of your having a buoyancy of spirit, you are gloomy, and cast a shadow upon the spirits of all around you. If we are sad, and depressed, and in trouble, you could, if in right conditions of health, have a clear brain to show us the way out, and speak a comforting word to us. If your brain is so benumbed by your wrong course of living that you cannot give us the right counsel, do we not meet with a loss? Does not your influence seriously affect us? We may have a good degree of confidence in our own judgment, yet we want to have counsellors; for in many counsellors there is safety. We desire that our course should look consistent and proper to those we love, and we wish to seek their counsel, and have them able to give it with a clear brain. But what care we for your judgment, if your brain nerve-power has been taxed to the utmost to take care of improper food, or an enormous quantity of even healthful food, placed in your stomachs, and the vitality withdrawn from the brain?

I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air; but I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection, lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.” In running the race, in order to obtain that laurel which was considered a special honor, those who engaged in running were temperate in all things. They were temperate, that their muscles, and their brains, and every part of them, should be in the very best condition to run. If they were not temperate, they would not have that elasticity that they would have if they were temperate in all things. If temperate, they could run that race successfully. They were more sure of receiving the crown. But notwithstanding all their efforts in the direction of temperance, and to subject themselves to a careful diet, in order to be in the best condition, yet they only ran at a venture. They might do the very best they could, and yet after all not receive the token of honor; for another might be a little in advance of them, and take the prize. One only received the prize. But we can all run in the heavenly race, and all receive the prize. It is not an uncertainty. It is not to run at a risk. We must put on the heavenly graces, with the eye directed upward to the crown of immortality, keeping the Pattern ever before us. He was a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with grief. The self-denying life of our divine Lord we are to keep constantly in view. His life of poverty, humbleness, and self-denying, we must not forget. And then as we seek to imitate him, keeping our eye upon the mark of the prize, we can run this race with certainty, knowing that if we do the very best we can we shall certainly secure the prize.

Therefore there is a very great responsibility resting upon parents and guardians who have children to bring up. Parents have taken the responsibility of bringing these children into existence. And what now is their duty? Is it to let them come up just as they may? and just as they will? Let me tell you, a weight of responsibility rests upon these parents. Whether you eat, or whether you drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. Do you do this when you are preparing food for the table, and when you place it upon your tables, and call your family to partake of it? Are you placing only the food before these children that you know will make the very best blood? Is it that food that will preserve their systems in the least feverish condition? Is it that which will place them in the very best relation to life and health? Is this the food that you are studying to place before your children? Or are you careless and reckless of their future good? and provide for them unhealthful, stimulating, irritating food? Let me tell you that the children from their very birth are born to evil. Satan seems to have control of them. He seems to take possession of their young minds, and they are corrupted. Why do fathers and mothers act as though a lethargy was upon them? They do not mistrust that Satan is sowing evil seed in their families. They are as blind, and careless, and reckless, in regard to these things as it is possible for them to be. Why do they not awake, and study these things? Why are they not reading up?

It is to consult your own pleasure, your own appetites; and while you have been doing this, Satan has been gaining a march upon you, and, as it generally happens, has frustrated your efforts every time. Some of you fathers have taken your children to the physicians to see what was the matter with them. I could have told you in two minutes what was the matter. Your children are corrupt. Satan has obtained control of them. He has come right in past you, while you, who are as God to them, to guard them, were at ease, stupefied, and asleep.

Every time I hear of these, I feel like clothing myself in sackcloth. “Oh! that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears.” “Spare thy people, O Lord.” I feel distressed. I have an agony of soul that is beyond anything that I can describe to you. You are asleep. Would the lightning and thunder of Sinai arouse this church?

They sit down to the table, and instead of considering how much they should eat, they give themselves up to appetite, and eat to great excess. And it is all they can do, and all they should do, the rest of that day, to let the stomach worry away with its burden imposed upon it. All the food that is put into the stomach that the system cannot derive benefit from, is a burden to nature in her work. It hinders the living machine. The system is clogged. It cannot successfully carry on the work of life. The vital organs are unnecessarily taxed. The brain nerve-power is called to the stomach to help the digestive organs carry on their work of disposing of an amount of food which does the system no good. So you see you have lessened the power of the brain by drawing so heavily upon it to help the stomach get along with its heavy burden. And after it has accomplished the task, what are the sensations you have experienced as the result of this unnecessary expenditure of vital force? A feeling of goneness, a faintness, as though you must eat more. Perhaps this feeling comes just before meal time. What is the cause of this? Nature has worried along with her work, and is so thoroughly exhausted in her efforts in consequence, that you have this sensation of goneness. And you think that the stomach says, More food, when, in its faintness, it is distinctly saying, Give me rest. The stomach needs rest to gather up its exhausted energies for another work. But instead of your allowing it any period of rest, you think the stomach needs more food, and so you heap another load upon nature, and refuse it all the rest it needs. It is like a man laboring in the field all through the former part of the day until he is weary. He comes in at noon. He says that he is weary and exhausted; but you tell him to go to work again and he will obtain relief. This is the way you treat the stomach. It is thoroughly exhausted. And you call the vitality from other parts of the system to the stomach in the effort of digestion."},{"refcode_short":"T18 15.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 18, p. 15.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"You have felt a numbness around the brain.

You have felt as though you did not want to engage in labor, mental or physical, to any extent, until you have rested from the sense of this burden imposed upon your system. Then, again, there is this sense of goneness. But you say it is more food that is wanted. You place a double load of food for the stomach to take care of. Even if you are most strict in the quality of your food, do you glorify God in your bodies and spirits, which are his, by partaking of such a quantity of food? Those who place so much food upon the stomach, and thus load down nature, could not appreciate the truth, should they hear it dwelt upon. They could not arouse the benumbed sensibilities of the brain to realize the value of the atonement, and the great sacrifice that has been made for fallen man. It is impossible for such to appreciate the great, precious, and exceedingly rich reward that is in reserve for the faithful overcomers.

The stomach is debilitated, the digestive organs weakened, and disease, with all its train of evils, is brought on as the result. If they were diseased before, they are now increasing the difficulties upon them, and lessening their vitality every day they live. They call their vital powers into unnecessary action to take care of the food that they place in their stomachs. What a terrible condition is this to be in! We know something of dyspepsia by experience. We have had it in our family. And we feel that it is a much-to-be-dreaded disease. And when a person becomes a thorough dyspeptic, he is a great sufferer, mentally and physically, and his friends must also suffer, unless they are as unfeeling as brutes. And yet will you say, It is none of your business what I eat, or what course I pursue? Does anybody around the dyspeptic suffer? Just take a course that shall irritate them in any way. How natural to be fretful! They feel bad. Their little children appear to them to be very bad. They cannot speak calmly to their children. They cannot, without especial grace, act calmly in their families. All around them are affected by the disease upon them. All around them have to suffer the consequences of their infirmity. They cast a dark shadow. Then, does not your eating and drinking affect others? It certainly does. And you should be very careful to preserve yourself in the best condition of health, that you may render to God perfect service, and do your duty in society and to your family. Then, even health reformers can eat immoderately of a healthy quality of food. They can err in the quantity. Some in this house err in the quality. They have never taken their position upon health reform. They have chosen to eat and drink what they pleased, and when they pleased. They are injuring their systems in this way. They are tearing down their systems, and injuring their families, by placing upon their tables a feverish diet, which will increase the animal passions of their children, and lead them to care but little for heavenly things. The parents are thus strengthening the animal, and lessening the spiritual, powers of their children. And what a heavy penalty will they have to pay in the end!

They have frequently manifested the same imperfections which are upon the children. They have eaten improperly, which has called the nervous energies of the being to the stomach, therefore they could not have vitality to expend in other directions. They could not properly control their children, because of their own impatience. Neither could they teach them the right way. Perhaps they would take hold of them roughly, and give them an impatient blow. I have said that to shake a child would shake two evil spirits in, while it would shake one out. If a child is wrong, to shake it only makes it worse. It will not subdue it. When the system is not in a right condition, the circulation broken up, and the nervous power has all that it can do to take care of the bad quality of food, or too great quantity even of that which is good, parents have not self-command. They cannot reason from cause to effect. Here is the reason that, in every move they make in their families, they create more trouble than they cure. They do not seem to understand and reason from cause to effect, and they go to work just like blind men. They seem to act as though it would especially glorify God for them to move like wild men, and if anything wrong should occur in their families, to put it down with roughness and violence. Who are our children? They are only our younger brothers and sisters of the family that God acknowledges as his. We are dealing with the members of the Lord's family.

I have spoken of the importance of the quantity and quality of food being in strict accordance with the laws of health. We would not recommend an impoverished diet. I have been shown that many take a wrong view of the health reform, and live upon an impoverished diet. They subsist upon a cheap, poor quality of food, prepared without care or reference to the nourishing of the system. It is important that the food should be prepared with care, that the appetite, when not perverted, can relish it. The idea should never be given that it is of but little consequence what we eat, because we, from principle, leave meat, butter, mince pies, spices, lard, and that which irritates the stomach and destroys health. There are some who go to extremes. They must eat just such an amount, and just such a quality, and confine themselves to two or three things. They allow only a few things placed before them, or their families, to eat. In eating a small amount of food, and that not of the best quality, they do not take into the stomach that which will suitably nourish the system. And the system cannot convert poor food into good blood. An impoverished diet will impoverish the blood. I will mention the case of Sr. Hartshorn, of Amherst, N. H. That case was presented to me to show an extreme. Two classes were presented before me: First, those who were not living up to the light God had given them. They started in the reform because somebody else did. They did not understand the system for themselves. There are many of you who profess the truth, who have received it because somebody else did, and you could not, for your life, give the reason. This is why you are as weak as water. Instead of your weighing your motives in the light of eternity, instead of your having practical knowledge of the principles underlying all your actions, instead of your having dug down to the bottom, and built upon right foundations for yourself, you are walking in the sparks kindled by somebody else. And you will fail in this, as you have in the health reform. Now if you had moved from principle, you would not have done this. There are two classes. One class cannot be impressed with the necessity of eating and drinking to the glory of God. The indulgence of appetite affects them in all the relations of life. It is seen in their families, in their church, the prayer-meeting, and in the conduct of their children. It has been the curse of their lives. You cannot make them understand the truths of these last days.

Changes should be made with great care. And we should seek to move cautiously and wisely. We want to take that course which can recommend itself to the intelligent men and women of the land. Large quantities of sugar and milk eaten together are injurious. They impart impurities to the system. Animals from which milk is obtained, are not always healthy. They may be diseased. A cow may be apparently well in the morning, and die before night. Then she was diseased in the morning, and her milk was diseased, but you did not know it. The animal creation is diseased. Flesh-meats are diseased. Could we know that animals were in perfect health, I would recommend people to eat flesh-meats sooner than to eat large quantities of sugar and milk. It would not do you the injury that sugar and milk do. Sugar clogs the system. It hinders the working of the living machine. There was one case in Montcalm County to which I will refer. The individual was a noble man. He stood six feet, and was of noble appearance. I was called to visit him in his sickness. But previous to this, I conversed with him in regard to his manner of living. I do not like the looks of your eyes, said I. He was eating large quantities of sugar. I asked him why he did this? He said that he had left off meat, and did not know what would supply its place as well as sugar. His food did not satisfy him. It was simply because his wife did not know how to cook. Some of you send your daughters, who have nearly grown to the size of women, to school to learn the sciences before they know how to cook. It is of the first importance to teach them to cook. Here was a woman who did not know how to cook. She had not learned to prepare healthful food. The cooking was poor in that house. The wife and mother was deficient in this important branch of education, and as the result, poorly-cooked food not being sufficient to sustain the demands of the system, sugar was eaten immoderately, which brought on a diseased condition of the entire system. This man's life was sacrificed unnecessarily to bad cooking. When I went to see the sick man, I tried to tell them as well as I could how to manage, and soon he began to improve slowly. He imprudently exercised his strength when not able, ate a small amount not of the right quality, and was taken down again, This time there was no help for him. His system appeared to be a living mass of corruption. He died a victim to poor cooking.

If food is withheld too great a length of time, the stomach's craving for it will create fever, which a proper allowance of food, of a proper quality, will relieve. It gives nature something to work upon. If there is a great desire expressed for food, even during the fever, to gratify that desire with a moderate amount of simple food, would be less injurious than for the patient to be denied.

All that is taken into the stomach, above what the system can use to convert into good blood, will clog the machinery; for it is substance which cannot be made into either flesh or blood, and its presence burdens the liver, and produces a morbid condition of the system. The stomach is over-worked in its efforts to dispose of it, and then there is a sense of languor, which is interpreted to mean hunger, and without allowing the digestive organs time to rest from their severe labor, to recruit their energies, another immoderate amount is taken into the stomach, to set the weary machinery in motion again."},{"refcode_short":"T18 87.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 18, p. 87.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The system receives less nourishment from too great a quantity of food than from a less quantity, taken at regular periods, and of the right quality."},{"refcode_short":"T18 87.2","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 18, p. 87.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"My brother, your brain is benumbed.

Violent exercise should not be engaged in immediately after a full meal; neither should the student engage in study; for this would be a violation of the laws of the system. Immediately after eating, there is a strong draught upon the nervous energy, calling into active exercise the brain force, concentrating it upon the field of labor, which is the stomach; therefore, when the mind or body is taxed heavily after eating, the process of digestion is hindered.

Jesus, when reviled, abused, and insulted, did not retaliate.” “Who-, when he was reviled, reviled not again.” When the cruelty of man caused him to suffer painful stripes and wounds, he threatened not; but committed himself to Him who judgeth righteously. The apostle Paul exhorted his Philippian brethren, “Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus; who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men.” Is the servant greater than his master? Christ has given us his life as a pattern, and we dishonor him when we become jealous of every slight, and are ready to resent every injury, supposed or real. It is not an evidence of a noble mind to be prepared to defend self, to preserve our own dignity. We had better suffer wrongfully a hundred times, than to wound the soul by a spirit of retaliation, or by giving vent to wrath. There is strength to be obtained of God. He can help. He can give grace and heavenly wisdom. If you ask in faith, you will receive; but you must watch unto prayer. Watch, pray, and work, should be your watchword."},{"refcode_short":"T18 107.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 18, p. 107.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Your wife might be a blessing if she would only take the responsibility upon her that it is her duty to take.

She should, for years back, have been educating herself to bear burdens. Sr. —— is not in health. She is predisposed to torpid liver, and is not inclined to exercise. Unless she sees that she must, she has not the faculty to set herself to work. She eats nearly double the amount which she ought to eat. All she takes into her stomach, above that which her system can convert into good blood, becomes waste matter, to burden nature in the disposal of it. Her system is clogged with a mass of matter, which hinders her in her work, clogs the machinery, and weakens the life-forces. Taking more food into the system than it can convert into good blood, causes a depraved quality of blood, and taxes the vitality to a much greater degree than labor or physical exercise. This over-eating causes a dull stupor. The brain nerves are called to aid the digestive organs, and are constantly being over-taxed and weakened. The sensitive nerves of the brain are benumbed by the action of the nerve-power being called to the stomach to aid the digestive organs. This leaves a sense of dullness in the head, and is making her every day liable to a shock of paralysis. Encouragement to cease exercise is not what is required. Physical exercise is very essential. There would be nothing so dangerous as to remain where her physical powers would not be called into active exercise. This will strengthen her body and mind. When she awakes to the responsibility of her position, and sees the benefit which will result from her seeking to have an aim in life, she will not be so-disposed to sink down into indolence, and to shun hardships. She does not put her heart into what she does; therefore, she moves about mechanically, too much like a machine, feeling that labor is a burden. She cannot, while she feels thus, realize that new life and vigor which it is her privilege to have. She lacks spirit and energy. She is too much inclined to be lost in dullness, and leaden insensibility. The heavy torpor she feels can only be overcome by a spare diet, perfect control over her appetite, and all her passions, calling her will to her aid in the point of exercising.

They see that Satan is deceiving the inexperienced and unsuspecting, yet they take it all quietly, as though they hail no special interest, as though these things did not concern them. They apprehend no special danger. They see no cause to raise an alarm.

These men are unnecessarily disturbed and excited, and seem unwilling to give us any quietude or rest. Ye take too much upon yourselves, seeing the congregation is holy, every one of them.

It is impossible to arouse the moral sensibilities of those persons who are addicted to the habit of self-abuse, to appreciate eternal things. You cannot lead such to delight in spiritual exercises. Impure thoughts seize and control the imagination, and fascinate the mind, and next follows an almost uncontrollable desire for the performance of impure actions. If the mind were educated to contemplate elevating subjects, the imagination trained to reflect upon pure and holy things, it would be fortified against this terrible, debasing, soul-and-body-destroying indulgence. It would, by training, become accustomed to linger upon the high, the heavenly, the pure, and the sacred, and could not be attracted to this base, corrupt, and vile indulgence."},{"refcode_short":"T18 170.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 18, p. 170.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"What can we say of those who are living right in the blazing light of truth, yet daily practicing and following in a course of sin and crime.

There should have been a specified time for each meal, and the food should have been prepared free from grease in a simple form; but pains should have been taken to have it nutritious, healthful, and inviting. There has been in this family, as also in many families, a special parade made for visitors, many dishes prepared and frequently made too rich; so that those seated at the table would be tempted to eat to excess. Then in the absence of company there was a great reaction, a falling off in the preparations brought on the table. The diet was spare and lacked nourishment. It was considered not so much matter “just for ourselves.” The meals were frequently picked up, and the regular time for eating not regarded. Every member of the family was injured by such management. It is a sin for any of our sisters to make such preparations as mentioned, for visitors, and wrong their own families by a spare diet which will fail to nourish the system."},{"refcode_short":"T18 192.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 18, p. 192.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The brother spoken of felt a lack in his system.

The spirit of truth and a good conscience are sufficient to inspire and regulate the motives and conduct of those who learn of Christ and are like him. Those who have not strength of religious principles in themselves have been easily swayed, by the example of others, in a wrong direction. Those who have never learned their duty from God, and acquainted themselves with his purposes concerning them, are not reliable in times of severe conflict with the powers of darkness. The external and present appearances will sway them. Worldly men are governed by worldly principles. They can appreciate no other.

Although these dark ones may stand between the truth and those who have not fully taken hold upon it, and their dark shadow may appear for a time to cloud the bright luster of truth, yet, in reality, it does not. The truth of heavenly origin is undimmed. Its purity and exalted character are changeless. It lives; for it is immortal. Cling to the truth. Obtain an experience for yourself, my beloved sister. You have an individuality. You are accountable only for how you use the light which shines upon your pathway, independent of all others. The lack of consecration in others will be no excuse for you. Their perverting the truth by their wrong course of action, because they are unsanctified by it, will not render you less responsible. A solemn obligation is resting upon you to exalt the standard of truth, to bear it aloft, even if the standard-bearer faints and falls. Do not you leave the precious standard to trail in the dust. Seize the lowered standard; bear it aloft, even at the peril of your good name, your worldly honor, and your life, if required. My much respected sister, I entreat of you to look up.
