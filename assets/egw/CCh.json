In that better land there will be no more sin, no disappointments, no hunger, no poverty, no sickness, and no death. When the apostle John contemplated the privileges that await the faithful, he exclaimed: “Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God....

These prophets, these men and women chosen of God as channels of communication, have spoken and written what God has revealed to them in holy vision. The precious word of God comprises these messages. Through these prophets members of the human family have been led to an understanding of the conflict that goes on for the souls of men, the conflict between Christ and his angels and Satan and his angels.

This remnant church would also have “the testimony of Jesus,” which is “the spirit of prophecy.” Revelation 19:10.

This volume, published in many languages, brings to many people what was shown in these vision of the Great Controversy.

As Daniel tells of what was revealed to him, in several instances he says, “I saw in the night visions.” Likewise, in Mrs. White's experience visions were given to her when her mind was at rest during the hours of the night. Her writings often contain the introductory statement: “In the visions of the night some things were clearly presented to me.” Frequently God spoke to the prophet in a prophetic dream. Questions may arise concerning the relationship between a prophetic dream or night vision, and an ordinary dream.

Except on rare occasions, the Lord did not give him the very words to speak. Nor did the angel guide the hand of the prophet in the precise words to record.

In each case, however, it was a very vivid experience that made an indelible impression on the mind of the prophet. And just as that which we see and experience makes a much deeper impression on our minds that what we only hear, so the representations to the prophets, where they seemed to witness dramatic events, made deep and lasting impressions on their minds.

An excellent illustration of this may be found in connection with the locating of the health food factory at Loma Linda, in the western part of the United States. The manager and his associates were planning to erect a large building very near the main sanitarium building. While plans were developing, Mrs. White, at her home hundreds of miles away, was one night given two visions. Of the first vision she says:"},{"refcode_short":"CCh 16.4","refcode_long":"Counsels for the Church, p. 16.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"“I was shown a large building where many foods were made.

Within a few hours of the vision, Mrs. White was writing to the workers at Loma Linda, and this settled the question of where the food factory should be built. Had their original plan been carried out, we would have been much embarrassed in later years with a large commercial building right near the sanitarium. Thus it can be seen that in varied ways the messenger of the Lord received information and instruction through the visions by day or by night."},{"refcode_short":"CCh 16.7","refcode_long":"Counsels for the Church, p. 16.7 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"It was from an enlightened mind that the prophet spoke forth or wrote, conveying the message of instruction and information to the people.

The bottom appeared like fire; a rainbow was over the cloud, while around it were ten thousand angels, singing a most lovely song; and upon it sat the Son of man. His hair was white and curly and lay on His shoulders; and upon His head were many crowns. His feet had the appearance of fire; in His right hand was a sharp sickle; in His left, a silver trumpet.

And I saw a table of pure silver; it was many miles in length, yet our eyes could extend over it. I saw the fruit of the tree of life, the manna, almonds, figs, pomegranates, grapes, and many other kinds of fruit. I asked Jesus to let me eat of the fruit. He said, “Not now. Those who eat of the fruit of this land go back to earth no more.

But sin is sin, whether committed by the possessor of millions or by the beggar in the streets. Those who secure property by false representations are bringing condemnation on their souls.

All who have any true sense of what is embraced in being a Christian know that the followers of Christ are under obligation as His disciples to bring all their passions, their physical powers and mental faculties into perfect subordination to His will. Those who are controlled by their passions cannot be followers of Christ. They are too much devoted to the service of their master, the originator of every evil, to leave their corrupt habits and choose the service of Christ.170Child Guidance, 444-446"},{"refcode_short":"CCh 111.2","refcode_long":"Counsels for the Church, p. 111.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"When the young adopt vile practices while the spirit is tender, they will never obtain force to fully and correctly develop physical, intellectual, and moral character.171Testimonies for the Church 2:351"},{"refcode_short":"CCh 111.3","refcode_long":"Counsels for the Church, p. 111.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The only hope for those who practice vile habits is to forever leave them if they place any value upon health here and salvation hereafter.

While sinful amusements are condemned, as they should be, let parents, teachers, and guardians of youth provide in their stead innocent pleasures, which will not taint or corrupt the morals. Do not bind down the young to rigid rules and restraints that will lead them to feel themselves oppressed and to break over and rush into paths of folly and destruction. With a firm, kind, considerate hand, hold the lines of government, guiding and controlling their minds and purposes, yet so gently, so wisely, so lovingly, that they will still know that you have their best good in view.217Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 335"},{"refcode_short":"CCh 161.3","refcode_long":"Counsels for the Church, p. 161.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"There are modes of recreation which are highly beneficial to both mind and body.

As Joshua was pleading before the Angel, so the remnant church, with brokenness of heart and earnest faith, will plead for pardon and deliverance through Jesus their Advocate. They are fully conscious of the sinfulness of their lives, they see their weakness and unworthiness, and as they look upon themselves they are ready to despair. The tempter stands by to accuse them, as he stood by to resist Joshua. He points to their filthy garments, their defective characters. He presents their weakness and folly, their sins of ingratitude, their unlikeness to Christ, which has dishonored their Redeemer. He endeavors to affright the soul with the thought that their case is hopeless, that the stain of their defilement will never be washed away. He hopes to so destroy their faith that they will yield to his temptations, turn from their allegiance to God, and receive the mark of the beast. Satan urges before God his accusations against them, declaring that they have by their sins forfeited the divine protection, and claiming the right to destroy them as transgressors. He pronounces them just as deserving as himself of exclusion from the favor of God. “Are these,” he says, “the people who are to take my place in heaven and the place of the angels who united with me? While they profess to obey the law of God, have they kept its precepts? Have they not been lovers of self more than of God? Have they not placed their own interests above His service? Have they not loved the things of the world? Look at the sins which have marked their lives. Behold their selfishness, their malice, their hatred toward one another.”"},{"refcode_short":"CCh 353.1","refcode_long":"Counsels for the Church, p. 353.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The people of God have been in many respects very faulty.

Thou canst not do this, O Lord, in justice. Thy throne will not stand in righteousness and judgment. Justice demands that sentence be pronounced against them.”"},{"refcode_short":"CCh 353.2","refcode_long":"Counsels for the Church, p. 353.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"But while the followers of Christ have sinned, they have not given themselves to the control of evil.

The despised remnant are clothed in glorious apparel, nevermore to be defiled by the corruptions of the world. Their names are retained in the Lamb's book of life, enrolled among the faithful of all ages.
