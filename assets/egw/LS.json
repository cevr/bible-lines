In company with my twin sister and one of our schoolmates, I was crossing a common in the city of Portland, when a girl about thirteen years of age, becoming angry at some trifle, threw a stone that hit me on the nose.

These lectures produced a great sensation, and the Christian church on Casco Street, where the discourses were given, was crowded day and night.

I took this paper home and read it to the family. In contemplating the event predicted, I was seized with terror; the time seemed so short for the conversion and salvation of the world.

But there was in my heart a feeling that I could never become worthy to be called a child of God. I had often sought for the peace there is in Christ, but I could not seem to find the freedom I desired. A terrible sadness rested on my heart.

In his remarks the speaker referred to those who were wavering between hope and fear, longing to be saved from their sins and receive the pardoning love of Christ, yet held in doubt and bondage by timidity and fear of failure. He counseled such ones to surrender themselves to God, and venture upon His mercy without delay. They would find a gracious Saviour ready to present to them the scepter of mercy, even as Ahasuerus offered to Esther the signal of his favor. All that was required of the sinner, trembling in the presence of his Lord, was to put forth the hand of faith and touch the scepter of His grace.

Jesus alone cleanses from sin; He only can forgive our transgressions. He has pledged Himself to listen to the petition and grant the prayer of those who come to Him in faith. Many have a vague idea that they must make some wonderful effort in order to gain the favor of God. But all self-dependence is vain.

But Jesus seemed very near to me; I felt able to come to Him with all my griefs, misfortunes, and trials, even as the needy ones came to Him for relief when He was upon earth. There was a surety in my heart that He understood my peculiar trials, and sympathized with me.

Now the sun shone bright and clear, and flooded the earth with light and warmth. The trees and grass were a fresher green, the sky a deeper blue. The earth seemed to smile under the peace of God.

My mind was very much exercised on the subject of baptism. Young as I was, I could see but one mode of baptism authorized by the Scriptures, and that was immersion.

I felt it a great privilege to attend these lectures; for I had fallen under discouragements, and did not feel prepared to meet my Saviour. This second course created much more excitement in the city than the first. With few exceptions, the different denominations closed the doors of their churches against Mr. Miller.

Believe that He accepts you now!” This I tried to do, but found it impossible to believe that I had received a blessing which, it seemed to me, should electrify my whole being.

If He would lay aside His humiliation and sufferings, and cry, “If any man will come after Me, let him please himself, and enjoy the world, and he shall be My disciple,” the multitude would believe and follow Him.

They will not dare to rest until Christ is formed within, the hope of glory. Self will die; pride will be expelled from the soul, and they will have the meekness and gentleness of Christ.” [From an unpublished manuscript.]"},{"refcode_short":"LS 431","refcode_long":"Life Sketches of Ellen G.

That life was linked with the Eternal; it was wrought in God. The message proclaimed and the work done constitute a monument that will never crumble nor perish. The many volumes she has left, dealing with every phase of human life, urging every reform necessary to the betterment of society as represented by the family, city, state, and nation, will continue to mould public sentiment and individual character. Their messages will be cherished more than they have been in the past. The cause to which her life was devoted, and which that life influenced and advanced to so great a degree, will press forward with increasing force and rapidity as the years go by. We who are connected with it need entertain no fear except the fear of our own failure to do our part as faithfully and loyally as we should.”"},{"refcode_short":"LS 476","refcode_long":"Life Sketches of Ellen G.

Haskell called attention to the words of the psalmist, “Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.” Psalm 116:15. Some may regard this as a strange statement; it is nevertheless true. The servants of God who are now sleeping, are to Him exceeding precious. So long as time shall last, the influence of their godly life will continue to yield rich fruitage. No longer can the enemy of the human race imperil their welfare; they are safe from his power. Jesus claims them as His own, and on the morning of the resurrection He will bestow upon them fullness of joy."},{"refcode_short":"LS 476.2","refcode_long":"Life Sketches of Ellen G.

All such, we are assured, are accounted blessed of God. Nor are their unceasing efforts to bear aloft the banner of truth, without result; “their works do follow them.” Today, in the light of this assurance direct from heaven to the children of men, we can say of our dear sister who now sleeps, that she “being dead yet speaketh.” Hebrews 11:4."},{"refcode_short":"LS 477.1","refcode_long":"Life Sketches of Ellen G.

The apostle Paul, in his first epistle to the sorrowing ones there, comforts them with the certainty of the Christian's hope. “Sorrow not, even as others which have no hope,” he exhorts; “for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent [go before] them which are asleep. For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.” 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18."},{"refcode_short":"LS 477.2","refcode_long":"Life Sketches of Ellen G.

Bitterly disappointed in not finding her Lord, “Mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulcher, and seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him.” Her heart cried out after her Saviour, and at that very moment He was by her side, though she recognized Him not. “Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing Him to be the gardener, saith unto Him, Sir, if Thou have borne Him hence, tell me where Thou hast laid Him, and I will take Him away."},{"refcode_short":"LS 478.1","refcode_long":"Life Sketches of Ellen G.

There is something very touching in this narrative. It shows that the Saviour is willing to reveal Himself to those who are devoted to Him and to His service,—those who desire above all things else to maintain a living connection with heaven. As Mary recognized her Lord after His resurrection by His voice and His general demeanor, so I believe we shall be able to recognize again our sister who now sleeps. While we cannot hear her voice in this world any more, yet her influence lives; and in the resurrection morning, if we remain faithful, and have a part with the people of God in that glad hour, we shall hear her voice once more, and we shall recognize her. My dear friends, there is a living connection between heaven and this earth still, and the promises the Lord has made to His people will be verified. Not one word will fail of fulfillment. May the Lord help us all to be among those who shall meet their Lord in peace, and who shall have the privilege of greeting our sister in the kingdom of heaven. May God grant it for His name's sake.”"},{"refcode_short":"LS 479.1","refcode_long":"Life Sketches of Ellen G.

Jesus has declared: “I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die.” Elder Evans also read, from the apostle Paul's inspired testimony in 1 Corinthians 15, many positive and comforting assurances concerning the resurrection of the righteous. “If there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.” “If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept.” “In Christ shall all be made alive.” “Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?” “Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.”"}]
