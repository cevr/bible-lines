Overlabor was not the cause of his sickness. He accompanied his brother-in-law on a pleasure trip to Chicago to see the place. The cars were delayed, and he was obliged to wait, on an unpleasant, rainy night, till near morning in the depot, before the cars came along. He traveled all the next day over Chicago, in a rain storm, and returned in the night to Battle Creek. This exposure brought on fever. This desire for a pleasure trip led him to desert his post of duty, and what makes this appear still worse, sister Van Horn, at this very time, was absent from the Office in consequence of fever brought upon her by the sudden death of her mother. Bro. Smith was also from the Office, in Rochester, N. Y., recovering from a fever. There was a great amount of unfinished work, and that Bro. Gage should feel at liberty, in my husband's absence, to neglect pressing duties which related to the interests of the cause generally, to take a pleasure excursion, is astonishing. Yet he left his post of duty to gratify his own pleasure. This fact in Bro. Gage's experience is a sample of the man.

It is only by exercising principle in the small transactions of ordinary life that we are tested and our characters formed. In the varied circumstances of life we are tested and proved, and thereby we acquire a power to stand the greater and more important tests that we are called to endure, and are qualified to fill still more important positions. The mind must be trained through daily tests to habits of fidelity, to a sense of the claims of right and duty above inclination and pleasure. Minds thus trained are not wavering between right and wrong, as the trembling reed in the wind, but as soon as matters come before them, they discern at once that there is a principle involved, and they will instinctively choose the right without long debating the matter.

He has opened before me many channels of light, not only for my benefit, but for the benefit of his people at large.

While standing under these burdens that no other one would venture to take, he has sometimes, under the pressure of care, spoken without due consideration and with apparent severity. He has sometimes censured those in the Office because they did not take care. And when needless mistakes have occurred, he has felt that indignation for the cause of God was justifiable in him. This course has not always been attended with the best results.

I was shown that my husband should stand there no longer, unless there are men who will feel the wants of the cause and bear the burdens of the work, while he shall simply act as a counsellor. He must lay the burden down; for God has an important work for him to do in writing and speaking the truth.

There never has been a more important period in the history of Seventh-day Adventists than at the present time. Instead of the publishing work diminishing, the demand for our publications is greatly increasing. There will be more to do instead of less. My husband has been murmured against so much, and has contended with jealousy and falsehood so long, and he has seen so little faithfulness in men, that he has become suspicious of almost every one, even of his own brethren in the ministry. The ministering brethren have felt this, and for fear that they should not move wisely, in many instances, have not moved at all. But the time has come when these men must unitedly labor and lift the burdens. The ministering brethren lack faith and confidence in God. They believe the truth, and in the fear of God they should unite their efforts and bear the burdens of this work which God has laid upon them. If after one has done the best he can in his judgment, and the other thinks he can see where he could have improved the matter, he should kindly and patiently give the brother the benefit of his judgment, but should not censure or question his integrity of purpose any sooner than he would wish to be suspected or unjustly censured himself. If the brother who feels the cause of God at heart sees, in his earnest efforts to do, that he has made a failure, he will feel deeply over the matter, for he will be inclined to distrust himself, and lose confidence in his own judgment; nothing will weaken his courage and God-like manhood, like a sense of his mistakes and errors that he has made in the work God has appointed him to do, which work he loves better than his life. How unjust then for his brethren that discover his errors to keep pressing the thorn deeper and deeper into his heart, to make him feel more intensely when with every thrust he is weakening faith, courage, and confidence, in himself to do, and to work successfully in the upbuilding of the cause of God. Frequently the truth and facts are to be plainly spoken to the erring to make them see and feel their error, that they may reform. But this should ever be done with pitying tenderness, not with harshness or severity, but consider their own weakness, lest they also be tempted. When the fault is seen and acknowledged, then comfort should be given instead of grieving him, and seeking to make him feel more deeply. In the sermon of Christ upon the mount, he said, “Judge not, that ye be not judged; for with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.” Our Saviour reproved for rash judgment. “Why beholdest thou the mote in thy brother's eye;” and, “behold a beam is in thine own eye.” It is frequently the case that while one is quick to discern the errors of his brethren, he may be in greater faults himself, and is blind to his own errors. We should, all who are followers of Christ, deal with one another exactly as we wish the Lord to deal with us in our errors and weaknesses, for we are all erring, and need pity and forgiveness of God. Jesus consented to take human nature, that he might know how to pity, and that he might know how to plead with his Father in behalf of sinful, erring mortals. He volunteered to become man's advocate, and he humiliated himself to become acquainted with the temptations wherewith man was beset, that he might succor those who should be tempted, and he be a tender and faithful high priest."},{"refcode_short":"T21a 111.1","refcode_long":"Testimony to the Church — No. 21a, p. 111.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"There is frequent necessity for plainly rebuking sin and reproving wrong. But ministers engaged in the work of the salvation of their fellow-men, should not be pitiless toward the errors of one another, and should not make prominent the defects in their organization. They should not expose or reprove their weaknesses. They should inquire if such a course would bring about the desired effect with themselves, would it increase their love for, and confidence in, the one who thus made prominent their mistakes. Especially should the mistakes of ministers who are engaged in the work of God be kept within as small a circle as possible, for there are many weak ones who will take advantage if they are aware that those who minister in word and doctrine have weaknesses like other men. And it is a most cruel thing for the faults of a minister to be exposed to unbelievers, if that minister in future is counted worthy to labor for the salvation of souls. No good can come of this exposure, but only harm. God frowns upon this course, for it is undermining the confidence of the people in those whom God accepts to carry forward his work. The character of every fellow-laborer should be jealously guarded by brother ministers. Saith God, “Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.” Love and confidence should be cherished. A lack of love and confidence in one minister for another does not increase the happiness of the one thus deficient, but as he makes his brother unhappy, he is unhappy himself. There is greater power in love than was ever found in censure.

He engaged at one period in reading exercises, and robbed himself of necessary sleep in order to read. This pleasurable exercise was carried to extremes, and was a serious injury to his health. His habits were not in harmony with physical law. This extra tax unfitted Bro.

The amount Bro; Andrews has at times placed in his stomach has called the brain nerve power to that organ, to carry on the work of the stomach, and has robbed him of vitality that he might have preserved. Bro. Andrews has a sacred duty to preserve the health God has given him. When engaged in writing, he enjoys the study of books, and does not give himself sufficient recreation and change. To read and write steadily is not best for the health, or for the clearest productions of the mind. Physical exercise should be united with mental effort.

And more recently, months of precious time have been used up in wearisome labor, chasing after the dishonest quibbles of a man who once kept the Bible Sabbath, but afterward rejected it. His opposition is so great upon the Sabbath question that he is insane upon the subject. The time spent in following Preble so closely and thoroughly has been a mistake. The readers of the Review have become wearied with the subject. A set of quibbles have been furnished the readers of the Review of no special weight only to deceive and darken minds.
