The frames are strong, and I have been seating them with drilling. Butter is so high that we do not purchase it, neither can we afford potatoes. We use sauce in the place of butter, and turnips for potatoes. Our first meals were taken on a fireboard placed upon two empty flour barrels.

From a human point of view this was indeed a bold prediction. The believers were very few in number, poor in this world's goods, and their views were very unpopular. Yet God, with whom all things are possible, has marvelously fulfilled this word. Through the years since that time, the publication of truth-filled literature by this denomination has steadily increased, until the sale of this printed matter, in all parts of the world, aggregates about $7,000,000 annually."},{"refcode_short":"CET 251.3","refcode_long":"Christian Experience and Teachings of Ellen G.

At a time when the manifestations of spiritualism were confined to the “mysterious rappings” In Rochester, New York, she was shown the rapid and phenomenal growth that cult would make in the future. She foretold the passing of laws enforcing Sunday observance in countries where at the time full religious liberty prevailed. All these predictions, and many others, have been published and widely circulated. The changing events that have taken place since these predictions were written have proved the truthfulness of many of them, and their fulfillment has inspired increased confidence that her prophecies concerning the final triumph of the Seventh-day Adventist cause will be likewise fulfilled. The prosperity of this movement has been signally advanced by the counsels and admonitions that have come, through her voice and pen, to its leaders and workers."},{"refcode_short":"CET 252","refcode_long":"Christian Experience and Teachings of Ellen G.

During these manifestations she was entirely unconscious of her earthly surroundings. Yet she would frequently walk about, making graceful gestures, while describing the scenes she was witnessing. Her strength at such times was phenomenal. Strong men have endeavored to move her hand or arm from the position in which it was held, but failed. On one occasion, at the home of Mr. Curtis, in Topsham, Maine, in 1845, she took from a bureau a large family Bible weighing about eighteen pounds, and, holding this at arm's length above her head with her left hand, she turned the pages with her right hand. Then, with her eyes directed upward away from the book, she read correctly many passages of scripture, pointing to the verses with the index finger of her right hand. With her ordinary strength she would have had difficulty even in lifting this heavy volume; but while supernaturally strengthened in vision, she held it aloft with outstretched arm for more than half an hour."},{"refcode_short":"CET 253.1","refcode_long":"Christian Experience and Teachings of Ellen G.

June 26, 1854, in Rochester, New York, while she was in vision two physicians endeavored to show that there must be breath in her lungs. Among other tests, a lighted candle was held as close to her lips as was possible without burning her; yet, although she was at that time speaking with force, there was not a flicker of the blaze. The first indication of her coming out of vision was a deep inhalation. Perhaps several seconds would elapse before the next breath.
