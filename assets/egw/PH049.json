And for the special preparation of those of our youth who have clear convictions of their duty to obtain a medical education that will enable them to pass the examinations required by law of all who practice as regularly qualified physicians, we are to supply whatever may be required, so that these youth need not be compelled to go to medical schools conducted by men not of our faith. Thus we shall close a door that the enemy would be pleased to have left open; and our young men and young women whose spiritual interests the Lord desires us to safeguard, will not feel compelled to connect with unbelievers in order to obtain a thorough training along medical lines."},{"refcode_short":"PH049 15","refcode_long":"Loma Linda’s Work, p. 15 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Teachers to Encourage a High Standard"},{"refcode_short":"PH049 15.2","refcode_long":"Loma Linda’s Work, p. 15.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"“The teachers in our medical college should encourage the students to gain all the knowledge they can in every department.

Neither should they discourage the students when mistakes are made. As errors and defects are kindly pointed out, the students in turn should feel grateful for any instruction given. A haughty spirit on the part of the students should be discouraged. All should be willing to learn, and the teachers should be willing to instruct, training the students to be self-reliant, competent, careful, painstaking. As the students study under wise instructors and unite with them in sharing responsibilities, they may, by the aid of the teachers, climb to the topmost round of the ladder."},{"refcode_short":"PH049 16","refcode_long":"Loma Linda’s Work, p. 16 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"No Carelessness in Work or Study"},{"refcode_short":"PH049 16.1","refcode_long":"Loma Linda’s Work, p. 16.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"“Students should go as far as possible in thought, training and intelligent enterprise; but they should never infringe upon a rule, never disregard one principle that has been interwoven into the upbuilding of the institution. The dropping down is easy enough; the disregard of regulations is natural to the heart inclined to selfish ease and gratification. It is much easier to tear down than to build up. One student with careless ideas may do more to let down the standard than ten men with all their efforts can do to counteract the demoralizing influence."},{"refcode_short":"PH049 16.2","refcode_long":"Loma Linda’s Work, p. 16.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"“Failure of success will be read in the course the students pursue. If they stand ready to question rules and regulations and order, if they indulge self, and by their example encourage a spirit of rebellion, give them no place. The institution might better close its doors than to suffer this spirit to leaven the helpers and break down the barriers that it has cost thought, effort and prayer to establish."}]
