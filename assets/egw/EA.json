By the time of her death, a large amount of material had been gathered and typed, but not completed. That material is presented here, divided chronologically into four sections: 1891-1892, 1893, 1894, 1895-1899. The pagination in the text given within parentheses, such as (285), is the pagination found in the White Estate’s copy; however, it is often irregular, with some pages missing, due to the incomplete nature of the working manuscript.

About twenty-five of our friends came to meet us at the boat, and say Goodbye. Soon the last parting words were spoken, and at four o’clock our good ship left the dock, and steamed out of Golden Gate against a strong head wind. The restless sea rocked and tossed us about, quite to the distress of the passengers, most of whom soon retired to their state rooms. For a time we felt inclined to lie quietly in our berths. After the first day, however, we had very pleasant, smooth sailing. The captain said he could hardly remember having so pleasant a voyage."},{"refcode_short":"EA 3.2","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 3.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Our vessel, though comparatively small, and not so elegant as many of the Atlantic boats, was thoroughly comfortable, convenient, and safe. The officers were kind and gentlemanly. (2) We had about eighty cabin passengers, and forty in the steerage. Among the former were about eight ministers, several of whom were returning from the great Methodist Conference in Washington. Religious services were held in the social hall, twice each Sunday, and occasionally on deck for the steerage passengers."},{"refcode_short":"EA 3.3","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 3.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"One week from the time we left California, we reached the Sandwich Islands. The scene presented to us from the steamer as we approached Honolulu, was very beautiful; the mountains rising at a little distance from the water’s edge, and clothed with the rich green of the tropics, and the city in its setting of palms and other tropical trees, appeared especially attractive to us after gazing for seven days on the boundless expanse of waters."},{"refcode_short":"EA 3.4","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 3.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"We were met at the wharf by friends living in the city. Men, women and children greeted us so heartily that we could not but feel at home among them. We were glad to welcome these dear friends, and especially glad to meet again Elder Starr and his wife, who had been laboring among the people, and speaking in the churches by invitation, with good effect."},{"refcode_short":"EA 3.5","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 3.5 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"(3) After a short visit in the family of one of our brethren, we were taken to ride about the city and a few miles beyond the suburbs. The business part of the town is very indifferent but the residences are fine, with broad verandahs, and surrounded by green lawns, which are beautified by all kinds of tropical trees and flowers. On our way we saw beautiful avenues of royal palms, vines, and trees, shrubs and hedges brilliant with flowers; cocoa-nut palms, laden with the brown, heavy looking fruit; bread fruit and mango trees; fields of pineapples, and patches of taro, the staple food of the natives, with many other strange plants and trees which I cannot even name."},{"refcode_short":"EA 3.6","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 3.6 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"For six miles back of the town the road gradually ascends a mountain valley to the “pali, ” or precipice, an interesting point, both for its historical association, and from the fine landscape view which is obtained from it. Standing on the rocky edge of the precipice, we look down 1200 feet, while on either side the bare, rocky summits tower to a height of 3000 feet. Below us lies a rich, green plain, dotted with rice and sugar plantations, and hills around which the brown road winds in and out. Beyond all is the broad blue sea, the white surf breaking (4) along the shore."},{"refcode_short":"EA 4.1","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 4.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"It was near the head of this valley, in about the eighteenth century that the last native chief of the island made a stand with his forces against Kamehameha I., who was trying to bring all the islands under one government. The chief’s forces were defeated, and fleeing up the valley many of them were driven over the precipice, and dashed to pieces on the rocks at its base. It is said that the bones of these unfortunate warriors are still to be found scattered on the plain."},{"refcode_short":"EA 4.2","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 4.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"We took our lunch on a pleasant, grassy spot overlooking the valley, and returned to the city, feeling that the day’s excursion would ever be remembered with pleasure."},{"refcode_short":"EA 4.3","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 4.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Then a few hours were spent at the home of a merchant in the city, whose wife has attended our meetings with much interest, and whose little daughter spent some months at our college at Healdsburg, Cal. The wife was among the friends who had met us at the boat, and I had called on her for a few moments in the morning on our way to the “pali.” I then bowed in prayer with them, at her request, placing my hands on the heads of the little ones, and invoking God’s blessing on the mother and the (5) children."},{"refcode_short":"EA 4.4","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 4.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Our steamer was not to leave Honolulu till past midnight, and at the earnest desire of our friends, I consented to speak in the evening. The hall of the Young Men’s Christian Association was secured for the purpose. Only a few hours’ notice of the meeting could be given, yet a goodly number were assembled, among them many who were actively engaged in temperance and Christian work. I spoke from 1 John 3:1 — 3, dwelling upon the great love of God to man, expressed in the gift of Jesus that we might become children of God. The Spirit of the Lord was present with us. At the close of the meeting we were gratified to make the acquaintance of some of the leading men of the Young Men’s Christian Association. Many spoke gratefully of the help that Elder Starr had rendered them. They expressed their regret that we could not remain longer, and gave us an earnest invitation to stay and labor a few months with them on our return to America. We too regretted that we must leave so soon."},{"refcode_short":"EA 4.5","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 4.5 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"We were grateful for the opportunity of becoming acquainted with the brethren and sisters in Honolulu."},{"refcode_short":"EA 5","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 5 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"(6) At Samoa and Auckland"},{"refcode_short":"EA 5.1","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 5.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"On Friday, November 2, we reached the Samoan Islands, after a pleasant voyage of seven days from Honolulu. We had expected extremely hot weather in passing the tropics, but in this we were happily disappointed. Only a few days were uncomfortably warm. On Tuesday, Nov. 24, when we crossed the equator, the air was so cool that we found our wraps needful as we sat on deck."},{"refcode_short":"EA 5.2","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 5.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Our steamer cast anchor off Apia, which is situated on the island of Upolu, and is the principal town of the Samoan Group. The harbor or Bay of Apia is a beautiful expanse of water, shut in by coral reefs, over which the water is constantly breaking. The island is clothed in the richest and most luxurious verdure. . The mountains rise almost from the water’s edge; the cocoa palms grow all along the shore and up the mountain sides, which are clothed in green to the very summits. The town of Apia consists of two rows of small white buildings on either side of a narrow street which winds along the shore."},{"refcode_short":"EA 5.3","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 5.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Through an opening in the reef that encloses the harbor vessels pass in and out; another reef lying nearer the shore, (7) prevents them from reaching the dock, but passengers are taken in shore in boats. Before us is a reminder of the terrible storms that sometimes visit this lovely spot. On the reef between us and the shore lies the hull of a German vessel, which was wrecked in the hurricane of March 1889, when seven men of war and fifteen merchant vessels were either wholly destroyed or stranded on the shore."},{"refcode_short":"EA 5.4","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 5.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Before our steamer comes to anchor, a novel sight greets our eyes; boats and canoes filled with natives crowd to the ship’s side, and soon we are surrounded with them in every direction. The natives are physically well developed, and are said to have the finest physique of any of the South Sea Peoples. They are of a light color brown color. Most of them are destitute of clothing, except for a mat or cloth about the loins; many are elaborately tattooed. Some wear broad-brimmed straw hats, some, turbans, while many of them have their hair dressed with lime, giving them the appearance of wearing a cap. The canoes are laden with articles for sale,—pineapples, bananas, oranges of a bright green color, but of excellent flavor, mangoes, limes, cocoanuts, and other tropical fruits, shells and coral, mats (8) and cloth, together with baskets and fans very neatly woven from the native grasses."},{"refcode_short":"EA 5.5","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 5.5 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Most of our party went ashore, and had an opportunity of seeing the natives in their homes. The huts are made by spreading over a wooden framework a covering of palm leaves and native grasses. For the floor the ground is covered with gravel or pounded coral, on which is spread a coarse matting. Mats form the beds at night, and the table and seats by day; large leaves and cocoanut shells serve as dishes."},{"refcode_short":"EA 5.6","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 5.6 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Our party was greeted cordially by the natives, who brought them flowers and seemed anxious to show their feelings of kindness.

Another year of my life had passed into eternity, and my record for a new year was begun. As I contemplate the past year, I am filled with gratitude to God for his preserving care and loving-kindness. At times I have been afflicted in (9) body and depressed in spirits, but the Lord has been my Redeemer, my Restorer. Many have been the rich blessings imparted to me."},{"refcode_short":"EA 6.2","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 6.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In the times of my greatest need I have been enabled to hold fast my confidence in my Heavenly Father. The bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness have been shining into my heart and mind, and the powers of darkness have been restrained; for Jesus our Saviour lives to make intercession for us. He is able to save soul, body and spirit, and to make us vessels unto honor, meet for the Master’s use. We are living in a perilous time, when all our powers must be consecrated to God, to do his will, and keep his way, irrespective of circumstances. We are to follow Christ in his humiliation, his self-denial, his suffering. His command is, “Be ye holy; for I am holy.” My heart is hungering and thirsting after righteousness. Through faith in Christ I am made partaker in his heavenly benefits. The exalted privileges, the great grace, revealed through Christ are for all who will obey the words of God. There are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these we may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. I receive and (10) enjoy these promises, full of divine mercy and truth. It is given me to know for myself that the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses from all unrighteousness."},{"refcode_short":"EA 6.3","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 6.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"We owe everything to Jesus, and renewedly I consecrate myself to his service, to work for him in a strange land, to lift him up before the people, to proclaim his matchless love. My prayer ascends day and night that the presence of Jesus may go before us. While lying in my stateroom the language of my heart has been, “My Redeemer, I beseech thee to engage for me in every conflict. I know in whom I have believed, and thy grace alone is my trust.” It is my prayer that I may through the coming year be a co-worker with Jesus in saving my own soul, which he has bought with his precious blood, and that every day I may learn his meekness and lowliness of heart, that he may use the frail, unworthy agent to bring souls out of darkness into light."},{"refcode_short":"EA 6.4","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 6.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I look unto Jesus: for his holy life is a faithful example. I must be daily moulded as the clay in the hands of the potter. I must educate my soul, that my confidence in God may be unlimited. Jesus said, “I can of mine own self do nothing.” How much more is this true of us?"},{"refcode_short":"EA 6.5","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 6.5 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"(11) The hope that I can be true or useful is in the atonement made for me. O that this sixty-fifth year of my life may be one of progress and perfection in the work which the Master has given me to do. I want clearer perception of truth daily that I may act in harmony with its holy principles. I have no happiness apart from doing the will of Christ and proclaiming to others his grace and truth."},{"refcode_short":"EA 6.6","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 6.6 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Between Samoa and Auckland we crossed the day line, and for the first time in our lives we had a [week] of six days.

Here is a beautiful harbor, and the town, on the hills above, presents a fine appearance. We had hoped to meet Elder Gates of the “Pitcairn” here, but in this we were disappointed. He had come here a month before, expecting to meet us on the arrival of the “Monowai.” As we did not come, he decided to make a trip to Norfolk Island, and return before our arrival. For some (12) reason he failed to meet us."},{"refcode_short":"EA 7.1","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 7.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"As our boat touched the wharf, a number of our brethren stepped on board, and introduced themselves to us; we had a glad meeting. On landing we rode to the house of Edward Hare. Here we found a pleasant home, and were refreshed with delicious strawberries, oranges, bananas, and more substantial viands. Then we had a very enjoyable ride into the country. The fresh sweet air, filled with the fragrance of wild roses, brier, and new-mown hay, reminded us of our northern summer; the green hedges separating the fields, make one think of England, while there is much in the landscape to resemble California. The vegetation and general appearance of the country is that of the temperate zones rather than the tropics."},{"refcode_short":"EA 7.2","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 7.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In the evening we met with the church at their house of worship, and I spoke to them in regard to the necessity of receiving Christ as their personal Saviour. When we thus accept him, the beauty of truth will be revealed in us; for in our words and in our life it will be presented as it is in Jesus. There will be no strife to see who shall be greatest, but we shall individually seek to represent Christ, and thus let our (13) light shine to the world. If the words of Jesus dwell in us, we shall represent his love in kindness, in humility, in goodness, coming in close union with the people of God, and working as missionaries of Jesus wherever we have opportunity. Instead of seeking to glorify ourselves, we shall exalt the name that is above every name, Jesus, the center of all attraction."},{"refcode_short":"EA 7.3","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 7.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"All who believe the truth should remember that they are to bear the credentials of Christ to the world, in their firm unity, their Christian courtesy, and love to one another. Wherever we may be every follower of Jesus can give to the world a practical illustration of the purity and the power of the truth. We should ever bear in mind that the world should criticize in the conduct of our temporal affairs. Do we work as Christians? That which we may speak in the church is not of half as much consequence as the influence we exert in our daily business life. We are constantly making either favorable or unfavorable impressions of the truth. We should manifest kindness, forbearance, and generosity, not to our brethren merely, but to all who do not love the truth."},{"refcode_short":"EA 7.4","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 7.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"(14) No man can have a sound healthful experience, unless he practices the instruction Christ has given through the apostle Peter: “Giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, patience; and to patience, godliness, and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and the brotherly kindness, charity. For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.”"},{"refcode_short":"EA 7.5","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 7.5 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"To be converted daily is to renew the soul’s life by receiving vital power from Christ, as the branch receives nourishment from the vine. The growth of every Christian is from within, not from without. It is only as the Spirit of Christ dwells in the heart by faith that we can grow in grace and in the knowledge of Christ. Only through the grace daily drawn from Jesus can the heart be kept. There can be no safety in extolling self; we must hide self in Jesus. Christ abiding within is the life of the soul. And we are to receive Christ through his word. It is the truth that sanctifies the soul. We should study the Scriptures even upon our knees, with earnestness and sincerity. The love of Jesus in the heart will (15) create a love for the searching of the word."},{"refcode_short":"EA 8.1","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 8.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The work of every child of God is to impart the knowledge of Christ to those who have it not. We must plant the seeds of truth wherever we can. The words of eternal life, sown in many hearts, will bring forth fruit in righteousness. The heavenly intelligences are waiting for God’s human agencies to consecrate themselves fully to him, that he may use them as channels of light. We need to realize our responsibility to cooperate with the heavenly agencies. We belong to God; he has purchased us with the blood of his only begotten Son; we are to represent to the world what Christ is to us."},{"refcode_short":"EA 9","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 9 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In Australia"},{"refcode_short":"EA 9.1","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 9.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"We entered Sydney Harbor at seven o’clock on the morning of December 8. The sea rolled heavily during the night, and it was difficult to keep safely in our berths; but all our party were able to be on deck when we entered the harbor, which is one of the most beautiful in the world. Before we reached the landing, we could see our friends on shore, and could distinguish Brother and Sister Daniells, the only ones present whom we knew. (16) Soon a hearty and tender welcome was accorded us. After a wholesome and well prepared breakfast at Brother Daniells, our party, with the canvassers, Bible workers, and a few friends, united in a precious season of worship."},{"refcode_short":"EA 9.2","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 9.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"We remained in Sydney one week, and had an opportunity to see something of this large and beautiful city. I spoke to the people twice, at the commencement of the Sabbath and on Sabbath morning. The Lord gave me a special freedom, and the people rejoiced in the message of truth, which, as they testified, filled their hearts with joy and peace and the love of God. Brother Starr spoke on Sunday evening with good acceptance."},{"refcode_short":"EA 9.3","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 9.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"On reaching Melbourne, [Wed.] Dec. 16, we found our friends at the station waiting for us, some whom we knew, and some whom we did not know, and we were heartily welcomed by all. Horses and carriages were waiting, and conveyed us two or three miles to the Echo Office. In Federal Hall, in the office building, we found a large company assembled to welcome us to Australia, and to unite with us in thanksgiving to God for his preserving and tender care during the long passage across the water. Elder Starr, W.C. White and myself each addressed a few words to those whom we were meeting now for the first time in a new country; (17) and as we united in a season of prayer, the Lord blessed us together. After the benediction, we were introduced to many of the brethren and sisters."},{"refcode_short":"EA 9.4","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 9.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"On Sabbath, Dec. 19, I spoke in Federal Hall. I had freedom and my soul was blessed as I spoke the words of life to an attentive audience. There was a social meeting in the afternoon, when many precious testimonies were borne. My heart was made glad in the Lord, and I could not but exclaim, “What hath God wrought?” as I looked upon this large company who had accepted the Bible just as it reads, and heard them speak of their faith. Humility in obedience to God is a hard lesson for fallen humanity to learn. There is something in the human, unsanctified heart that rises up in opposition to inspired truth, when it requires separation from former associations and customs in taking a position on the Sabbath which the Lord has blessed and sanctified as his memorial of creation. May the light of those who have had the courage and sincerity and simplicity of faith, shine forth in good works, that more may be added to the faith, of such as shall be saved."},{"refcode_short":"EA 9.5","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 9.5 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"On [Fri, 25] Christmas day our hall was full. Many had come in from Sydney, Adelaide, and Ballarat, and the smaller churches.

They urged that as one whom the Lord was specially teaching I could help the work here as others could not. I felt no inclination to go, and had no light that it was my duty. The journey was a dread to me. I desired to remain at home and complete my work on the Life of Christ and other writings. But as the matter was introduced, and the responsible men of the conference expressed their conviction that I in company with others should visit this field, I decided to act in accordance with their light. I feared that my own unwillingness to go was the reason why I had no more evidence on the point."},{"refcode_short":"EA 10.2","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 10.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I made the long journey and the conference held in Melbourne. I bore a decided testimony. The Lord gave me tongue and utterance to reprove, to entreat, and to present principles of the greatest importance to the people and to the work. The burden was heavy upon me, and just before the (20) conference closed I was stricken with a severe illness. For eleven months I suffered from malarial fever and inflammatory rheumatism."},{"refcode_short":"EA 10.3","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 10.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"During this period I experienced the most terrible suffering of my whole life. I was unable to lift my feet from the floor without suffering great pain. My right arm, from the elbow down, was the only part of my body that was free from pain. My hips and my spine were in constant pain. I could not lie on my cot for more than two hours at a time, though I had rubber cushions under me. I would drag myself to a similar bed to change my position. Thus the nights passed."},{"refcode_short":"EA 10.4","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 10.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"But to all this there was a cheerful side. My Saviour seemed to be close beside me. I felt His sacred presence in my heart, and I was thankful. These months of suffering were the happiest months of my life, because of the companionship of my Saviour. He was my hope and crown of rejoicing. I am so thankful that I had this experience, because I am better acquainted with my precious Lord and Saviour. His love filled my heart. All through my sickness, His love, His tender (21) compassion, was my comfort,"},{"refcode_short":"EA 10.5","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 10.5 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Physicians said I would never be able to walk again, and I had fears that my life was to be a perpetual conflict with suffering. But I would not give up, and the constant effort that I made, because of my faith that I could still be the Lord’s messenger to the people, accomplished a great change in my health. Some of the meetings that I attended at this time were from four to twelve miles from home. On some of these occasions I was enabled to speak for a hour at a time. The fact that I could speak in public in spite of my crippled condition, was an encouragement to my brethren and sisters."},{"refcode_short":"EA 10.6","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 10.6 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"During those eleven months of suffering I continued my work of writing.

Many sleepless hours of the night I spent in going over our experience since we (22) left America for. It was a time of continual anxiety, suffering and burden bearing. I felt at first that I could not bear this inactivity: I think I fretted in spirit over it; and at times darkness gathered about me. This unreconciliation was at the beginning of my suffering and helplessness; but it was not long before I saw that the affliction was a part of God’s plan. I carefully reviewed the history of the past few years, and the work the Lord had given me to do. Not once had he failed me. Often He manifested Himself in a marked manner; and I saw nothing in the past of which to complain. I realized that like threads of gold, precious things had run through all experience."},{"refcode_short":"EA 11.1","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 11.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Then I prayed and realized sweet comfort in the promises of God: “Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you.” “When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against.” These promises were fulfilled to me. Jesus came sacredly near, and I found His grace all-sufficient. My soul stayed upon God. I could say from a full heard, “I know in whom I have believed.” God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are (23) able, but will with the temptation make a way of escape, that ye may be able to bear it.” Through Christ I came off more than conqueror."},{"refcode_short":"EA 11.2","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 11.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"My time of physical suffering was made a blessing to me. Although not raised up in answer to prayer, I found a compassionate Saviour, who loved me, and revealed Himself to me. The comfort and blessing I received in answer to prayer helped me to bear my great suffering. I decided that the Lord had determined something concerning me which I could not understand, and I was content to trust all with Him. I kept saying, God knows what is best; sees that which in my humanity I do not see. “Whom He did foreknow He also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren.” I will not fret and murmur; I will not give up in discouragement. I will leave myself in the hand of God. He will not forsake me while I put my trust in Him. He will transform me into His image, and accomplish His will in me."},{"refcode_short":"EA 11.3","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 11.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"When we comply with the Written Word then we are to walk by faith.

You are just as surely doing the work of God in engaging in physical labor, if this is necessary, as in opening the Scriptures to others. “He that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in much.” It should be of the highest satisfaction (396) to us to know that even the little things are noticed by God. Take some of the small pins out of a large machine, and watch the result. I know of an instance where a workman failed to put into a saw upon which he was working only one little pin. When the machine was set in operation, the saw flew hither and thither, and as a result one man was deprived of a limb.

When I was only twelve years old I knew what it was to economize. With my sister I learned a trade, and although we could earn only a shilling a day, we were able to save a little means for the cause of God. We saved a little at a time until we had six pounds.

There is to be no spasmodic, hasty action taken by church members in cutting off those they may think defective in character.

It is difficult to break down these barriers and obtain an opportunity to introduce the leaven of truth and proclaim the last message of mercy and warning to the people. As in Christ’s day, the ministers will not investigate the Scriptures, and candidly compare the doctrines presented with their Bibles, but rather seize upon some lying report, some scandal from far off or from near at hand, and present a false statement to their congregations as an evidence that they should close their ears to the “strange doctrines” of the Seventh-day Adventists. Through (536) these lying reports the people whose minds have been stirred up by the truth are quieted down, and as they have not the moral courage to investigate the Scriptures for themselves, or to ferret out the falsehood, they turn from the man who have the message of God.

This led to more lessons on the subject, and a sermon on “Higher Criticism” that was well attended by the people of Napier. We were surprised to see the extent to which our own people were affected by this infidelity, and were satisfied that in this alone there was abundant explanation for the lack of success that has of late attended the canvassing work. We see more and more clearly, that in all our labors the Bible must be exalted, and that our people must come to know the wisdom and the power that are in the word of God.

A tent meeting had (Camp-12) recently been held in this place, and there are a few who obey the message, and others who are on the point of decision. Our meeting was in a large hall, and although the audience was not large, those present seemed much interested. We had a most comfortable conveyance, and the ride was enjoyable. Near Hastings, we passed a Maori village, where preparations were being made for a national council. In one enclosure there was a church and several whares—large houses in which they entertain a large number of guests,—also long tents in which hundreds were to be served with food; in other fields near by were long rows of little tents, for the occupancy of those coming from abroad. The Maoris seem to be an intelligent people, and true missionary work is much needed among some of their tribes.

The large pavilion had not yet been pitched, because it was holiday time, and nothing could be obtained on a holiday, however urgent the want. Those who came to the workers’ meeting received most precious things from the word of God.

Our papers and publications had been the messengers of God to them, and had sown the seeds of gospel truth in their hearts. In social meeting they told how they (3) were first led to see the light. To some the Sabbath truth had been revealed through reading “Great Controversy”; others had embraced the truth through reading “Thoughts on Daniel and the Revelation”; many had been much blessed by reading “Steps to Christ”. How great was the delight of these souls as they feasted on the rich banquet that heaven had prepared for them at the camp-meeting. I saw countenances lighted up, plainly impressed with the divine image. Many voices expressed the gratitude of joyful hearts as men and women contemplated the precious truths of the third angel’s message. They were led to understand more fully what is comprehended in this message, how all self must be renounced, all dependence upon self given up, and how Christ must be received in the heart as a complete Saviour.

An interest was awakened in Melbourne also and the surrounding suburbs greater than anything we had witnessed since the movement of 1844.

The president expressed an earnest desire that we should harmonize in the temperance work. “Be assured,” we said, “we shall enter every door open to us, that we may let our light shine to others.” I gave to each of them a copy of “Christian Temperance” and to one I gave “Great Controversy” and to the other “Patriarchs and Prophets”."},{"refcode_short":"EA 130.2","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 130.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The weather was all that we could desire for some time; then a wind and sandstorm came upon us, and it was necessary to place sentinels at every post of the tent to guard it.

M. said, “you are perfectly welcome to come to the campground, and here you shall have all the liberty you desire.” They consented to come, and bring their friends. They told Elder M. that they had come in the first place with a strong array of Scriptures, prepared to prove the abolition of the law; but that when he showed the relation existing between the law and sin and the gospel, they could not produce the arguments they had to present. (11) At this time the minister of the Congregational church was away on his vacation. When he was informed that the members of his church were being drawn away, he hurried back, and attended the special meeting with the young members of his flock.

At first I had hesitated, wondering if it were best to do so when my son and I were the only ones whom I could see who would give us any help on that occasion. But as though someone had spoken to me, the thought passed through my mind, “Cannot you trust the Lord?” I said, “I will, Lord.” Although my son was much surprised that I should make such a call on this occasion, he was equal to the emergency. I never heard him speak with greater power or deeper feeling than at that time. He called upon Brn. Faulkhead and Salisbury to come forward, and we knelt in prayer.

Some from Hawthorn had embraced the truth, and calls for preachers came from both these places. The temperance workers asked that instruction in healthful cooking might be given in their hall. Sister Starr went to act as teacher. The hall was provided with good facilities, so that after the lecture a practical illustration could be given of the best methods of healthful cookery. Sister Starr told them that she was not qualified to teach. “Well,” they said, “tell us what you know.” (23) After the camp-meeting, a tent was pitched at North Brighton, and Elders Corliss and Hare worked unitedly, and with success.

Several members of his church had embraced the truth during the camp, and this had hurt him. He came to the tent one evening, accompanied by a large number of his church members. This minister was the founder of the Council of the Churches in this country, and a man of wide influence. He asked the privilege of speaking after Elder Corliss had spoken (24) but was told that this could not be permitted, for it would do no good, and would only create confusion. He insisted, and said, “Will you put the matter to the vote?” This was a scheme on his part; for he had brought along his church members in order to carry the day. Elder Corliss replied, “No; I cannot give this meeting away.” Before the whole congregation he said, “I will give this minister the tent, free of expense, any night in the week except Sunday night, to speak the whole evening on this subject; but I cannot permit him to divert the minds of this congregation from important things.

One night, Elder Corliss felt, would not be sufficient to do justice to the subject. He hoped his proposition would be rejected, for the interest in his tent work was great, and he did not wish to drop it at this juncture.

They had sought earnestly after truth, and the feelings of the earnest seeker after truth are expressed in the words of the psalmist, where he says, ‘It is time, Lord, for thee to work; for they have made void thy law. Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold. Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right, and I hate every false way. Thy testimonies are wonderful; therefore doth my soul keep them. The entrance of thy words (28) giveth light; it giveth understanding unto them simple.’ A church was raised up in Hawthorn, and another in Brighton. About sixty belonged to these two churches. A large number of new members have been added to the Parham church and to the church in North Fitzroy. A number of members have also moved away; but persons are continually coming in who heard the truth at the Brighton camp-meeting. The Lord is drawing, and some are responding to his drawing. It would be a mistake to take the camp-meeting to Ballarat. Let the meeting be held where the people are, that they may not only attend, but sustain it.

But notwithstanding the hard times, we felt it was essential to have a camp-meeting in Melbourne before we could leave the country. We felt that, as far as it was consistent with our circumstances, we must make all things in the camp-meeting after the divine similitude, that it might leave the right impression upon the people as to what constitutes a camp-meeting after God’s order, and also it might give character to our work. We know this was all right; but all such advanced movements involve expense. Tents had to be made, and every arrangement planned with the strictest economy.

Some of us who know, had a true realization of the fact that we were devising and planning under the supervision of heavenly intelligences.

In the sight of God we were regarded as a peculiar people in a different sense. “For thou art an holy people into the Lord thy God: the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto Himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth. The Lord did not set His love upon you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people: but because the Lord loved you, and because He would keep the oath which He had sworn unto your fathers, hath the Lord brought you out with a might hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bond men, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

The encampment made the impression upon those who visited it that the truth we advocated was of great importance, and that the missionary spirit is the true spirit of the gospel.

He called together his family of grown-up sons and daughters and told them that he had decided that the seventh day was the Sabbath enjoined upon the human family to keep; he said he would be glad if they and their mother would unite with him in honoring the Sabbath day, but if they did not do this they must understand that no work must be done on his premises on the Sabbath. This man had two large orchards.

Why should (684) the poor saints be denied the blessing of giving to help those who are still poorer than themselves? The work of educating the people along these lines has been neglected, and the churches have failed to give for the necessity of poorer churches, and thus the blessing has been withheld until they have a realizing sense of their neglect. “For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich.

Not one trembling seeker need to fail of finding the true path, and of walking in pure and holy light; for Jesus leads the way. The path is so narrow, so holy, that sin cannot be tolerated therein, yet access to the path has been made for all, and not one desponding, doubting, trembling soul, needs to say, “God cares nought for me.” Every soul is precious in His sight; “for God so loved the world,” even in its blackness and disobedience, even with the heavy shadow of sin and Satan upon it, “that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” When Satan was triumphing as the prince of the world, claiming the world as his kingdom, when we were all marred and corrupted with sin, God sent his messenger from heaven, even His only begotten Son, to proclaim to all the inhabitants of the world, I have found a ransom; I have made a way of escape for the perishing. I have your emancipation papers prepared for you, sealed by the Lord of heaven and earth. You may have freedom upon the condition of faith in Him who is able to save unto the uttermost (705) all who come unto God by him. A ransom has been provided at infinite cost, and it is not because there is any flaw in the title which has been purchased for you that you do not accept it. It is not because the mercy, the grace, the love of the Father and the son is not ample, and has not been freely bestowed, that you do not rejoice in pardoning love, but it is because of your unbelief, because of your choice of the world that you are not comforted by the grace of God. It is your love of disobedience, your pleasure in sin, your enjoyment of rebellion that has blunted your perceptions until you fail to discern the things that make for your peace. If you are lost, it will be because you will not come unto Christ that you may have life. God waits to bestow the blessing of forgiveness, of pardon for iniquity, of the gift of righteousness upon all who will believe in His love, and accept His salvation. Christ is ready to say to the repenting sinner, “Take away the filthy garments from him. . . . Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment; and I said, “Let them set a fair mitre upon His head. So they set a fair mitre upon His head, and clothed him with (706) garments.” “Thus saith the Lord of hosts, If thou wilt walk in my ways, and wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge mine house, and shalt also keep my courts; and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.” Christ is the connecting link between God and man.

He must not consume in selfish indulgence everything he gains, and present nothing to God in acknowledgement of the fact that he is constantly the recipient of Heaven’s gifts. The Christian will be constantly imparting that which is bestowed upon him. True religion is imitation of Christ. Not one of Christ’s true followers will practice self-indulgence in any way when the cause of God is languishing because of the poverty of the people. God means that someone shall supply that which is wanting for the needs of the poorer brethren, and for the necessities of his cause. The kingdom of heaven must be the first consideration. To follow Christ means continually to study his life of self-denial and from high motives (710) to practice His good works. To follow means to render obedience. We are under service to God, and we must obey his commands. No soldier is counted a follower of his commander unless he obeys his general’s orders. The Master says, Learn of Me.

Jesus points the highest mind as well as the humblest to the lily in the freshness of the dew of morning, saying, “Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin, and yet I say unto you, That Solomon in all His glory was not arrayed like one of these.” And He impresses the lesson: “If God so clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall He not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith.” (778) Men make the work of advancing the truth tenfold harder than it would be, by seeking to take God’s work out of His hands into theirs. They undertake the job of tinkering up the defective characters of others, and only succeed in making the defects worse than before. The time thus spent is all the time making the work more complicated; for the Chief Worker is left out of the question in the care of his heritage.

And this is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou has sent.” All may obtain this education if they will. Jesus says, “I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word, . . . And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.” What a statement is this! “I am glorified in them.” This can be true of any soul only as he in sincerity becomes not merely a hearer but a doer of the Word of Christ. In Matthew these are likened to a wise man, “which built his house upon a rock: and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.”"},{"refcode_short":"EA 221.1","refcode_long":"Experiences in Australia, p. 221.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Jesus says, “Behold, I and the children whom thou hast given me.” To Jesus the whole human family is entrusted, as the flocks of sheep are entrusted to a shepherd.

He wants every advocate of truth to follow His example in this respect. Never meet railings and falsehoods and bitter accusings with the words of man’s wisdom. The Lord’s workers are never to make charges, never to make thrusts at opponents, but have the mind well stored with Scripture, and be able to draw the sword of truth, a “Thus saith the Lord.” (See Matt. 12:34 37.) Follow the plain Bible teachings if you would follow Jesus. Souls cost too much to be imperiled by following the words of men. We cannot safely accept any man’s decision in matters that involve eternal interests unless he can open the Scriptures and present his authority as from Him who is the Truth. Obey the words of Christ by searching the Scriptures, and through diligent study have the Word of God stored in your memory, so that in any emergency you can say earnestly, solemnly, “It is written.” Jesus says, “Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst, but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.” And He declared to the multitude at the Feast of Tabernacles, “He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.” As the Word of God is received into the heart, it transforms character and life.

It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.” It is the dragon that is wroth; it is the spirit of Satan that is revealed in anger and accusing. Not a semblance of the dragon’s spirit must be seen in the life or the character of Christ’s servants. The testimony you bear is to be a testimony to the truth as it is in Jesus. God’s servants, who have had great light and blessing from Him, are not to be like a blast of hail, to beat down and destroy. The salt that is to save from corruption is the confession of the truth, the revelation of the love of Christ. The magnifying of the law of Jehovah is not accomplished by breaking its principles.

There was nothing about the place to suggest the thought of sacredness, and we greatly needed another place where we could meet for the worship of God. I am sad when I think that I should have consented to meet in such a place for worship, that I neglected until the last the work that should have been done first. In the future in every place where I shall labor, I will make the spiritual necessities rather than the temporal of the first importance. The dearth of means was my excuse; but I should have walked by faith. I did not honor God as I should have done had I moved out in faith (221) notwithstanding seeming impossibilities.

To conduct meetings in this way would require that several be in progress at the same time, and this would not permit a few men to attend all the meetings.

All your life you have followed your own will and way, and you have not strength of character that comes only by perseveringly acting from principle. You have right impulses, and can speak those words that are right, but often you lose your hold of Christ, because you are not led and guided by the Spirit of God.

Today she is a helpless invalid, obliged to be lifted from place to place. She lives, but is as one dead, save that she is a burden and a care to those around her.

Suspecting that a design was on foot to damage his influence and to supplant him, he rejected counsel which should have been gratefully received.

His wife possessed unusual ability and influence, and both were in the employ of the conference, for her influence was fully equal to his. But their course of action was not in harmony with the principles of truth. At times Elder Daniels took his position strongly on the subject of health reform.

She has misrepresented and misinterpreted my words, and for her own sake, I cannot keep silent. I feel that the time has come for me to speak. When I heard of Brother McCullagh’s recent illness, I felt that I had a special work to do for Sister McCullagh, that I must open things before her.

You have not put yourself in the channel of light by placing yourself on the right side of the question, but by your course of action, you have tempted your husband to digress. His influence has not been sufficient to correct your wrong habits, but your influence has led him to disregard the principles of healthful living.

Men and women who disregard these principles cannot offer to God a pure, vigorous devotion, for a dyspeptic stomach or a torpid liver make the religious life an uncertainty. Eating the flesh of dead animals has an injurious effect upon spirituality. When meat is made the staple article of food, the higher faculties are overborne by the lower passions. There things are an offense to God and are the cause of a decline in spiritual life. Keep out of the stomach everything that will disturb the digestive organs; discard all food that affords no nourishment for the system.

But before your husband had time to learn what constituted health reform, you cast reproach upon its principles. By painstaking efforts you might have gained an education which would enable you to cook wholesome, nourishing food in a palatable manner, for health reform does not mean a poverty-stricken diet. But the articles of food which Brother McCullagh has been obliged to eat if he subsisted at all have been improperly prepared.

The milk and sugar it contains constitutes all the nourishment afforded by a cup of tea or coffee. Often tea that has been damaged is preserved by coloring it with that which contains poison, and in this way it is offered for sale.

Her conversation is not pure, for only those lips are without guile, only those words pure, that fulfill the requirements of the Lord, and He has told us to speak evil of no man.

How much harm you have done in this respect, you cannot know; you have influenced your husband in such a way that he has taken wrong views of persons and their work, and has been disqualified for doing the work of the Lord as acceptably as he might have done.

I wish another camp-meeting could be held in Adelaide, that the slime and filth which Satan has poured forth upon the servants of God might be washed away.

Should the fair words of men, one of whom has had no real experience with us as a people, be so readily accepted? How can our people, with their Bibles in their hands accept that which, if they would only consider, they must know is error and falsehood. The Lord has permitted this thing to be that warning may be given, just such things will take place again. Rebellion and apostasy are in the very air we breathe, and we shall be affected by it unless by faith we hang our helpless souls upon Christ. If men are so easily misled, how will they stand when Satan shall personate Christ, and work miracles. Who will be unmoved by his misrepresentations? What will hold God’s people from giving their allegiance to false Christ’s? The doctrine of our faith must be plainly understood.

We are not to throw our arms about the men who are Satan’s masterpieces for working out his will, as were the opposers on the campground at Adelaide.

I have ever felt great sadness when I thought of your denying the truth, because I believe you have had a genuine experience in the truth. You did fight manfully under the banner of Prince Emmanuel against the world, the flesh, and the devil. You did love the truth.
