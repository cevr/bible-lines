One of Mrs. White’s first tasks was to go into the field to meet fanaticism with the Word of God. Down through the seventy years of her ministry she was called upon again and again to meet fanatical or deceptive teachings in one form or another.

Eyewitness accounts report that in their services the fanatics worked up a high pitch of excitement by use of musical instruments such as organs, flutes, fiddles, tambourines, horns, and even a big bass drum. They sought a physical demonstration and shouted and prayed and sang until someone in the congregation would fall, prostrate and unconscious, from his seat. One or two men, walking up and down the aisle for the purpose, would drag the fallen person up on the rostrum. Then about a dozen individuals would gather around the prostrate body, some singing, some shouting, and some praying, all at the same time. When the subject revived, he was counted among those who had passed through the Gethsemane experience, had obtained holy flesh, and had translation faith. Thereafter, it was asserted, he could not sin and would never die. Elders S. N. Haskell and A. J.

Here many are deceived, and think that it is the want of food which produces such feelings, and without giving the stomach time to rest, they take more food, which for the time removes the faintness. And the more the appetite is indulged, the more will be its clamors for gratification. This faintness is generally the result of meat-eating, and eating frequently, and too much. The stomach becomes weary by being kept constantly at work, disposing of food not the most healthful. Having no time for rest, the digestive organs become enfeebled, hence the sense of “goneness,” and desire for frequent eating. The remedy such require, is to eat less frequently and less liberally, and be satisfied with plain, simple food, eating twice, or, at most, three times a day.

Some children may have at birth so strong constitutions that they can endure such abuse without its costing them life; yet thousands are sacrificed, and tens of thousands have the foundation laid for a short, invalid life, by the custom of bandaging and surfeiting the body with much clothing, while the arms—which are at such distance from the seat of life, and for that cause need even more clothing than the chest and lungs—are left naked.

The mother feeds it, thinking it must be hungry, when food only increases its suffering. Tight bands and an overloaded stomach do not agree. It has no room to breathe. It may scream, struggle and pant for breath, and yet the mother not mistrust the cause. She could relieve the sufferer at once, at least of tight bandages, if she understood the nature of the case. She at length becomes alarmed, and thinks her child really ill, and summons a doctor, who looks gravely upon the infant a few moments and then deals out poisonous medicines, or something called a soothing cordial, which the mother, faithful to directions, pours down the throat of the abused infant. If it was not diseased in reality before, it is after this process. It suffers now from drug-disease, the most stubborn and incurable of all diseases. If it recovers, it must bear about more or less in its system the effects of that poisonous drug, and it is liable to spasms, heart disease, dropsy on the brain, or consumption.

And then she carries the matter to its logical conclusion: “If those who thus enter the marriage relation were alone concerned, the sin would not be so great. Their offspring are compelled to be sufferers by disease transmitted to them.”— Ibid."},{"refcode_short":"2SM 482.6","refcode_long":"Selected Messages Book 2, p. 482.6 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The ability of the partners in a marriage to sustain themselves financially also was presented by Ellen White as a requisite for a successful marriage. She pointed out that there are those “who have not acquired property” and do “not possess physical strength, or mental energy, to acquire property” “who have been in haste to marry, and who have taken upon themselves responsibilities of which they had no just sense.” But it is the children who often are the greatest sufferers, for “those who are seriously deficient in business tact, and who are the least qualified to get along in the world, generally fill their houses with children” which, she declares, may not be “suitably fed or clothed, and do not receive physical or mental training” (Selected Messages 2:420, 421)."},{"refcode_short":"2SM 483.1","refcode_long":"Selected Messages Book 2, p. 483.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Then there is another area where counsel was given. This is in bringing together in marriage men and women of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Four such presentations are a matter of manuscript and published record. Two of the four statements on this point appear in this volume, on pages 343 and 344. These were penned in 1896 and 1912, respectively, and were selected for publication in this volume because they presented the basic principles involved and thus reveal why such marriages should not be encouraged. Such unions, it is declared, could easily create “controversy and confusion.” Another reason she set forth for discouraging such marriages seems to be the “disadvantages” which they impose upon the offspring, and this could lead to “a feeling of bitterness toward the parents who have given them this lifelong inheritance.” [Note: of the other two statements, the first presentation of counsel on this point appears in the heart of a basic appeal made by Ellen White on March 21, 1891, to the leaders of the church to enter upon a work for the colored people in the United States. See the full statement in The Southern Work, 1966 edition, 9-18. In this she drew in bold, unmistakable lines, the brotherhood of mankind and made clear that in worship all stood in equality before God. At the same time she gave voice to words of caution.

They should hold membership in the church with the white brethren. Every effort should be made to wipe out the terrible wrong which has been done them. At the same time we must not carry things to extremes and run into fanaticism on this question.
