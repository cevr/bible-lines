And that which is worse still, the mind becomes so wearied by the continuous exercise of prayer that no spiritual refreshment is realized, and the meeting to them is worse than a loss. They have become wearied mentally and physically, and they have obtained no spiritual strength. Meetings for conference and prayer should not be made tedious. All should, if possible, be prompt to the hour appointed; and if there are dilatory ones, who are half an hour or fifteen minutes even behind the time, there should be no waiting. If there are but two present, they can claim the promise. The meeting should open at the appointed hour, if possible, be there few or many present. Formality and cold stiffness should be laid aside, and all be prompt to duty. There should not be, upon any common occasion, prayer of more than ten minutes’ duration.

We should not allow even our minds to dwell upon things of a worldly character. The mind cannot be refreshed, enlivened, and elevated, by being confined nearly all the Sabbath hours within walls, listening to long sermons and tedious, formal prayers. The Sabbath of the Lord has been put to a wrong use, if thus celebrated. The object is not attained for which the Sabbath was instituted. The Sabbath was made for man, to be a blessing to him, by calling his mind from secular labor, to contemplate the goodness and glory of God. It is necessary that the people of God assemble to talk of him, to interchange thoughts and ideas in regard to the truths contained in the word of God, and to devote a portion of time to appropriate prayer.

They will not be in danger of associating the character of God with everything that is stern and severe. But as they view the beautiful things he has created for the happiness of man, they will be led to regard him as a tender, loving Father. They will see that his prohibitions and injunctions are not made merely to show his power and authority, but that he has the happiness of his children in view. As the character of God puts on the aspect of love, benevolence, beauty, and attraction, they are drawn to love him. You can direct their minds to the lovely birds making the air musical with their happy songs, the spires of grass, and the gloriously tinted flowers in their perfection perfuming the air. All these proclaim the love and skill of the heavenly Artist, and show forth the glory of God. Parents, why not make use of the precious lessons God has given us in the book of nature to give our children the correct idea of his character? Those who sacrifice simplicity to fashion, and shut themselves away from the beauties of nature, cannot be spiritually minded.

We can sit with them in the groves, and in the bright sunshine, and give their restless minds something to feed upon by conversing with them upon the works of God, and inspire them with love and reverence by calling their attention to the beautiful objects in nature. The Sabbath should be made so interesting to our families that its weekly return will be hailed with joy. In no better way can parents exalt and honor the Sabbath than to devise means to impart proper instruction to their families, and to interest them in spiritual things, giving them correct views of the character of God, and what he requires of us, in order to perfect Christian characters and to attain to eternal life.

From nature, only from nature; and yet these individuals will devote the entire strength of their being, and will bestow all their affections upon their tastes in this direction. Yet art can never attain the perfection seen in nature. Many withdraw their minds from the beauties and glories of nature that our Creator has prepared for them to enjoy, and devote all the powers of their being to perfection of art; yet all these things are only imperfect copies from nature.

None but those who understand the mystery of godliness, who have tasted the powers of the world to come, who have drank from the cup of salvation that has been presented to us.

These offerings were varied according to the estimate which the donors placed upon the blessings they were privileged to enjoy. Thus the characters of the people were plainly developed. Those who placed a high value upon the blessings God bestowed upon them, brought offerings in accordance with their appreciation of his blessings. Those whose moral powers were stupefied and benumbed by selfishness and idolatrous love of the favors received, rather than of fervent love for their bountiful Benefactor, brought meager offerings.

If those who ministered in the sacred office should fail to manifest care and reverence for God in their apparel and their deportment, the people would lose their awe and reverence for God and his sacred service. If the priests showed great reverence for God, by being very careful and very particular as they came into his presence, it gave the people an exalted idea of God and his requirements. It showed them that God was holy, that his work was sacred, and that everything in connection with the work of God must be holy; that it must be free from everything like impurity and uncleanness; and that all defilement must be put away from those that approach nigh to God. From the light that has been given me, there has been a carelessness in this respect. I might speak of it, as Paul presents it. It is carried out in will-worship and neglecting of the body.

That humility that savors of Heaven will be particular to have the person, and actions, and apparel, of all who preach the holy truth of God, right, and perfectly proper, so that every item connected with us will recommend our holy religion.

The example is to remove the fear of God from the people, and to detract from the sacred dignity of the gospel Christ died to magnify. According to the light that has been given me, it would be pleasing to God for them to bow down as soon as they step into the pulpit, and solemnly ask help from God. What kind of an impression would that make? There would be a solemnity and awe upon the people. Why, their minister is communing with God. Their minister is committing himself to God before he dares to venture to stand before the people. Solemnity rests down upon the people, and angels of God are brought very near. Ministers should look to God the first thing as they come into the desk, thus saying to all, God is the source of my strength. A minister negligent of his apparel often wounds those of refined sensibilities and good taste. Those who are backward in this respect, should correct their errors and be more circumspect. The loss of some souls at last will be traced to the untidiness of the minister. The first appearance affected the people unfavorably because they could not link his appearance in any way with the truths he presented.

Anciently the priests were required to have their garments in a particular style to do service in the holy place, and minister in the priest's office. They were to have garments in accordance with their work, and God distinctly specified what these should be. This laver was placed between the altar and the congregation, that before they came into the presence of God, in the sight of the congregation, they might wash their hands and their feet.

As he visits a family, he should inquire into the condition of that family. Is he the shepherd of the flock? The work of a shepherd is not all done in the desk. He should talk with all the members of the flock; with the parents, to learn their standing; and with the children, to learn theirs. A minister should feed the flock over which God has made him overseer. It would be agreeable to go into the house and study. But if you do this, to the neglect of the work God has commissioned you to perform, you do wrong. Never enter a family without inviting them together, and bowing down and praying with them before you leave. Inquire into the health of their souls. What does a skillful physician do? He inquires into the particulars of the case, then seeks to administer remedies. Just so the physician of the soul should inquire into the spiritual maladies with which the members of his flock are afflicted, then go to work to administer the proper remedies, and ask the great Physician to come to his aid.

This desire to obtain means for selfish purposes, by ministers, is a snare to them, which if they continue in, will prove their overthrow. As they get their eyes upon self, their interest in the prosperity of God's cause, and their love for poor souls, become less and less. They do not lose their love for, and interest in, the truth at once. It is a gradual work. Their departure from the cause of right is gradual and imperceptible, so much so that it is frequently difficult to tell the time when the change in them took place. I think your course highly dangerous. You have not felt the necessity of heeding the light God has given you, and arousing yourself to save your household, and acquitting yourself as a father and priest of your household. You did not deny the light given you. You did not rise up against it. But you neglected to carry it out, because it was not convenient, and agreeable to your feelings, to do this. Therefore you were like Meroz. You came not up to the help of the Lord, although the matter was of such vital consequence as to effect the eternal interests of your children. You neglected your duty. You were in this respect a slothful servant. You have but little sense of how God regards the neglect of parents to discipline their children. Had you reformed here, you would have seen the necessity of the same effort to maintain discipline and order in the church. Your slackness, that has been manifested in your family, has been seen in your labors in the church. You cannot build up the church until you are a transformed man. The neglect of the light that God has given you, has, in a degree, made you captive; subject to Satan's devices; therefore a door has been left open for him to gain access to you in other directions, and make you a weak man. Satan sees he has made a success of blinding your eyes to the interests of your family, in leading you to neglect the light the Lord has given. Satan has beset you in another direction. He has excited your love of traffic, your love of gain; and by doing this, your interest has been divided from the cause and work of God. The love of God and the truth is gradually becoming of less importance. Souls for whom Christ died are of less value to you than your temporal interests.

Then will the works of God's servants be fruitful; for they will indeed be his instruments. The power of God will be seen upon them in the gracious influences of his Spirit.

Many who profess to be ministers of Jesus Christ, manifest a wonderful submission in seeing the unconverted all around them going to perdition. A minister of Christ has no right to be at ease, and sit down submissively to the fact that the truth is powerless, and souls are not stirred by its presentation. They should resort to prayer, and should work and pray without ceasing. Those who submit to remain destitute of spiritual blessings, without an earnest wrestling for those blessings, consent to have Satan triumph. Persistent, prevailing faith is necessary.

They accept the goods lent them, yet claim them as their own, and forget that the Master has any claim upon them, and refuse to yield to him even the interest he demands. Riches cause the professed followers of Christ many perplexities, and pierce them through with many sorrows, because they will forget God, and love and worship mammon.

Talk with them faithfully, and beseech them to yield to the truth. “For we are unto God a sweet savor of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish; to the one, we are the savor of death unto death; and to the other, the savor of life unto life.” As the apostle views the magnitude of the work, and the weighty responsibilities resting upon the minister, he exclaims, “And who is sufficient for these things?” “For we are not as many which corrupt the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, speak we in Christ.” Those who corrupt the word, handing out wheat and chaff, or anything that they may deem gospel, while they oppose the commandments of God, cannot appreciate the feelings of the apostle while he trembled under the weight of the solemn work, and the responsibility resting upon him as a minister of Christ, having the destiny of souls, for whom Christ died, resting upon him."},{"refcode_short":"T20 192.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 20, p. 192.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In the estimation of self-made ministers, it will take but a small pattern to fill the bill, and make a minister. The apostle had a high estimate of the qualifications necessary to make a minister. The deportment of a minister while in the desk, should be circumspect, not careless. He should not be negligent of his attitude. He should have refinement and order, in the highest sense, God requires of those who accept so responsible a work, to receive the words from his mouth and speak them to the people, warning and reproving, correcting and comforting, as the case may require. God's representatives upon earth should be in daily communion with him. Their words should be select, their speech sound. The haphazard words frequently used by ministers who preach not the gospel in sincerity should be forever discarded."},{"refcode_short":"T20 193.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 20, p. 193.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I was shown, Bro. ——, that you had been naturally irritable, easily provoked, lacking patience, and forbearance. If your course was questioned, or you urged to take your position upon the truth, you have felt too much that you would not be hurried. You would not move a step because others desired you to. You would take your time. Should your hearers pursue the same course, you would consider them blame worthy. If all should do as you have done, God's people would require a temporal millennium in which to make the needed preparations for the Judgment. God has mercifully borne with your backwardness.

Then the character of his labor changed, and he pressed you to come to a decision and move out upon the light and evidence you had received. This earnest effort on his part, you termed crowding and jamming you; your mulish temperament was manifested. You rose up against this dealing and rejected the efforts he made to help you. Here you injured yourself and disheartened Bro. —— Your course displeased God; your feelings toward Bro. —— were not Christian. You gloried in your resistance of his efforts in your behalf. The Lord blessed the labors of Bro. ——, in raising up a people in the State of Maine. This labor was hard and trying, and you did your share in making it so. You have not realized how hard you was making the work for those whom God had sent to present the truth to the people. They were exhausting their energies to bring the people to the point of decision in regard to the truth, while you and others of the ministers stood directly in their way. God was working through his ministers to draw to the truth; and Satan was working through you and other ministers to discourage and counteract their labor. The very men professing to be watchmen who, if they had stood in the counsel of God, would have first received the word of warning and given it to the people, were among the last to accept the truth. The people were in advance of their teachers.

I was shown that a solemn work is to be accomplished for the ministers of Christ. This cannot be done without effort on their part. They must feel that they have a work to do in their own cases, which no other one can do for them. They must seek to gain the qualifications necessary, in order to make able ministers of Jesus Christ, that in the day of God they may stand acquitted, free from the blood of souls, having done all their duty in the fear of God. As their reward the faithful under shepherds will hear from the chief Shepherd, “Well done, good and faithful servant.” He will then place the crown of glory upon their heads, and bid them enter into the joy of their Lord. What is that joy? It is beholding with him the redeemed saints, seeing with Christ the travail for souls, the self-denial, the self-sacrifice, the giving up of ease, of worldly gain, every earthly inducement, and choosing the reproach, the suffering, the self-abasement, the wearing labor, the anguish of spirit, as men oppose the counsel of God against their own souls, the chastening of the soul before God, the weeping between the porch and the altar, and the becoming a spectacle unto the world, to angels, and to men. All this is then ended, and the fruits of the laborers are seen, as souls are saved through their efforts in Christ. The ministers who have been co-workers with Christ enter with him into the joy of their Lord, and are satisfied."},{"refcode_short":"T20 197.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 20, p. 197.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"“Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.

Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.” Ministers are too forgetful of the Author of their salvation. They think they endure much, when they bear and suffer but little.

If there had not been one Seventh-day Adventist minister in Maine to oppose the counsel of God, all that has been accomplished might have been done with one-half the effort that has been made; and the people might have been brought into order from their distracted, confused state, and now have been strong enough to stand against opposing influences.

It has required hard labor to counteract their influence while they were opposing the counsel of God against their own souls, and standing in the way of sinners. They would not enter in themselves, and them that would, they hindered by precept and example. There has been a mistake in following into fields where there were Adventists who do not as a general thing feel any necessity of being helped. They think themselves in a good condition, and able to teach others. The laborers are few, and their labor must be spent to the best possible advantage. Much more can be done in the State of Maine, as a general thing, where there is not one Adventist. New fields should be entered, and the time that has hitherto been spent in wearing labor for Adventists who have no wish to learn, should be devoted to new fields, going out into the highways and hedges, and working for the conversion of unbelievers. If Adventists will hear, and come, let them come. Leave the way open for them to come if they choose."}]
