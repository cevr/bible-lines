They were praying, fasting, searching, digging for the truth as for hidden treasures, and the Holy Spirit, we know, was teaching and guiding us. Many theories were advanced, bearing a semblance of truth, but so mingled with misinterpreted and misapplied scriptures that they led to dangerous errors. Very well do we know how every point of truth was established, and the seal set upon it by the Holy Spirit of God.

If the student of the Word would take the truths which God has revealed in the leadings of His people, and appropriate these truths, digest them, and bring them into their practical life, they would then be living channels of light.

To be singular for singularity's sake is positively detestable, below the dignity of a Christian, but to be singular because it is necessary to be so as the result of worshiping God and Him only, places Heaven's dignity upon man. We must not be afraid of being singular when duty requires us to be thus to exalt and honor God; and we must bear in mind that the work of Christ is specified. “Who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works” (Titus 2:14)."},{"refcode_short":"17MR 80.3","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 17 [Nos. 1236-1300], p. 80.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"“For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto Himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.
