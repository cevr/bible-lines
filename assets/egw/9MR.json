That triumphant death was witnessed by all heaven, by the whole universe. Satan bruised the heel of the seed of the woman, but in the act of Huss his head was bruised. In contrast to deeds of that council, uprooting truth and righteousness, in contrast to their cruelty to Huss, the martyr's constancy, his faith, his example, has been reflecting its light down along the times for centuries. His example has been encouraging others to submit their souls and bodies to God alone, to exalt God alone and take the Scriptures as their guide. This will make them the light of the world. This will make them examples of faith and courage and steadfastness in truth. This will nerve them to suffer and to endure, gaining victories even in sorrow and in death.

But you must understand there is no excuse that will stand in your favor before God for the sorrow and the anxiety and discouragement you have brought upon the cause of God by your perverted course as though the carrying out of your plans were superior to every temporal or spiritual interest.

She has been a woman who has seen much sorrow, and I know that God has worked for her. He has shown her favors and she has had a genuine experience in the things of God; and the suspicions expressed by yourself and others in reference to her some time ago, makes me feel very sad, because I do not think she deserves them.... You think she may not think everything her brethren in South Lancaster do is above criticism, and [her] not entering soul and spirit into every suggestion and plan has drawn upon her criticism and suspicion. I have great confidence in her for this, although she has made no complaints to me. Yet the words and the attitude of yourself, as well as others, toward her was, to say the least, not cordial. If there is a woman that loves and fears God, in South Lancaster, it is Sister Harris. If there is a woman I would fear to slight, or offend, because it would grieve the Spirit of God, it is Sister Harris. And those who would speak against her in any way to affect your feelings toward her, had better be on their knees before God, and get all that feeling out of their hearts, and not draw [away] from her, but come close to her, and show her sympathy and love. This changeable mood toward those who have been real pillars in the truth, I cannot see as bearing the divine stamp.—Letter 20, 1887, pp. 4, 5.

In the place of lifting their thoughts to God, in the place of learning to know Him better, men deny Him in their lives. Their attention is taken up with objects that conceal God from their view."},{"refcode_short":"9MR 386.2","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 9 [Nos. 664-770], p. 386.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Thus it is with the great majority of religionists. God calls for sincere heart-worship. The door to light and an intelligent knowledge of the truth is open to every sincere worker for God. In order for worship to be acceptable, it must be offered in faith and hope, and the life must be in harmony with it. God requires the devotion of heart, mind, soul, and strength. Our noblest powers are to be used to do Him homage. Our thoughts are to be conformed to His will; our affections sanctified to His service.—Letter 143, 1904, pp. 3, 4.

Brother Franke, thus yourself and your family are brought in, and God is left out. The creature is put before the Creator. The appetite of the people for a theatrical style of preaching may be satisfied, but the effects made have not saving results. Outward display, expensive arrangements, do not give the people the education in gospel missionary work that the Lord desires them to receive. These things work against the truth, hindering instead of advancing it; for the truth is mingled with common, worldly methods.

The health and strength that He has given us is to be carefully guarded. We are never to plan our work in a way that calls for a prodigal outlay of means or for an undue taxation of the mental and physical powers. The worker who plans his work in this way does great harm to himself. He worries, and his mind is worn out by his anxiety to make everything appear to what he supposes to be the best effect, for he gets nervous if he cannot obtain all the means he needs to carry out his plans to his satisfaction. While a worker follows such methods, he cannot be guided by the Holy Spirit. He is working in a worldly way to satisfy a worldly appetite. He forgets that true success is dependent on the One who has said, “Without Me ye can do nothing” (John 15:5). The things that should have taken the first and highest control of the mind are lost sight of in the effort to make a striking impression. The common fire, not the sacred fire of God's kindling, is used."},{"refcode_short":"9MR 388.1","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 9 [Nos. 664-770], p. 388.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In our effort to proclaim the truth, God's glory is ever to be kept in view.

Vegetarian restaurants, treatment rooms, cooking schools, are to be established. The people are to be taught how to prepare wholesome food. They are to be shown the need of discarding tea, coffee, and flesh-meat. There are to be suitably furnished rooms, where people can be received and given religious instruction. These things are necessary for the advancement of the work. The work is not to be carried on in such a self-sacrificing way that an unfavorable impression will be made on the minds of the people, because of its meager showing. All that is done is to bear favorable witness to the Author of truth. The worship of God in the beauty of holiness demands a dignity and nicety that is in harmony with the sacredness and importance of the truth.—Letter 49, 1902, pp. 4, 5, 8, 10-12. (To S. N.
