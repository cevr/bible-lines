Michigan has not had the labor which she should have had. God has planted important institutions among you, and this brings upon you greater responsibilities than upon any other Conference in the whole field. Great light has been given you, and few have responded to it; yet my heart goes out in tender solicitude for our beloved people in Michigan. The warning that the Son of man is soon to come in the clouds of heaven, has become to many a familiar tale. They have left the waiting, watching position. The selfish, worldly spirit manifested in the life, reveals the sentiment of the heart, “My Lord delayeth his coming.” Some are enveloped in so great darkness that they openly express their unbelief, notwithstanding our Saviour's declaration, that all such are unfaithful servants, and their portion shall be with hypocrites and unbelievers."},{"refcode_short":"T31 5.2","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 31, p. 5.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Our ministers are not doing their whole duty. The attention of the people should be called to the momentous event which is so near at hand. The signs of the times should be kept fresh before their minds. The prophetic visions of Daniel and John foretell a period of moral darkness and declension; but at the time of the end,—the time in which we are now living, the vision was to speak and not lie. When the signs predicted begin to come to pass, the waiting, watching ones are bidden to look up, and lift up their heads and rejoice because their redemption draweth nigh."},{"refcode_short":"T31 6.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 31, p. 6.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"When these things are dwelt upon as they should be, scoffers will be developed who walk after their own lusts, saying, “Where is the promise of his coming, for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation?” But “when they shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them.” “But ye, brethren, are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief.” Thank God, all will not be rocked to sleep in the cradle of carnal security.

Many who profess to be children of God, follow their worldly pursuits with an intensity that gives the lie to their profession. They will be planting and building buying and selling, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the last moment of their probation. This is the condition of a large number of our own people. Because iniquity abounds, the love of many waxes cold.

Selfish purposes are made the first consideration. The work of qualifying men to labor for the salvation of souls, is not considered of so great consequence as worldly enterprises. Souls are perishing for want of knowledge. Those who have had the light of present truth, and yet feel no spirit of labor to warn their fellow men of the coming Judgment, must give an account to God for their neglect of duty.

How careful should they be rightly to understand and explain the word of God. “Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein.” Says the prophet Ezekiel: “The word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman; if, when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people; then, whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul. But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand. So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.

It is the minister's duty to warn every man, to teach every man, in all meekness and wisdom. He is not to conform to the practices of the world, but, as God's servant, he must contend for the faith once delivered to the saints. Satan is constantly at work to break down the strongholds which debar him from free access to souls; and, while our ministers are no more spiritually minded, while they do not connect closely with God, the enemy has great advantage, and the Lord holds the watchman accountable for his success."},{"refcode_short":"T31 12.2","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 31, p. 12.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I would, at this time, sound the note of warning to those who shall assemble at our camp-meeting. The end of all things is at hand. My brethren, ministers, and laymen, I have been shown you must work in a different manner from what you have been in the habit of working. Pride, envy, self-importance, and unsanctified independence, have marred your labors. When men permit themselves to be flattered and exalted by Satan, the Lord can do little for them or through them. To what unmeasured humiliation did the Son of man descend, that he might elevate humanity! Workers for God, not the ministers only, but the people, need the meekness and lowliness of Christ, if they would benefit their fellow-men. As God, our Saviour humbled himself, when he took upon him man's nature. But he went lower still. As a man, “he humbled himself unto death, even the death of the cross.” Would that I could find language wherewith to present these thoughts before you. Would that the vail could be rent away, and you could see the cause of your spiritual weakness. Would that you could conceive of the rich supplies of grace and power awaiting your demand.

Instead of this, they should teach them that the sins of others are no excuse for them. Christ is the only true pattern. The wrongs of many would not excuse one wrong in them, or lessen in the least their guilt. God has given them one standard, perfect, noble, elevated.

Because the Lord had not given him a new revelation for that special time, those who were really seeking light, did not cast his message aside as only a common letter. No, indeed.

Those who united with them were so set in their opinions, that, notwithstanding the judgments of God in a marked manner destroyed the leaders and the princes, the next morning the survivors came to Moses and said, “Ye have killed the people of the Lord.” We see what fearful deception will come upon the human mind. How hard it is to convince souls that have become imbued with a spirit which is not of God. As Christ's embassador, I would say to you, Be careful what positions you take.

Faith rests upon evidence, not demonstration. The Lord requires us to obey the voice of duty, when there are other voices all around us urging us to pursue an opposite course. It requires earnest attention from us to distinguish the voice which speaks for God. We must resist and conquer inclination, and obey the voice of conscience, without parleying or compromise, lest its promptings cease, and will and impulse control. The word of the Lord comes to us all who have not resisted his Spirit by determining not to hear and obey. This voice is heard in warnings, in counsels, in reproof.

We should ever cherish a sense that, individually, we are standing before the Lord of hosts; no word, no act, no thought, even, should be indulged, to offend the eye of the Eternal One. We shall then have no fear of man or of earthly power, because a Monarch, whose empire is the universe, who holds in his hands our individual destinies for time and eternity, is taking cognizance of all our works.

Well may we exclaim, “Help, Lord, for the godly man ceaseth, for the faithful fail from among the children of men.” I know that many think far too favorably of the present time. These ease-loving souls will be engulfed in the general ruin. Yet we do not despair. We have been inclined to think that where there are no faithful ministers, there can be no true Christians; but this is not the case. God has promised that where the shepherds are not true he will take charge of the flock himself. God has never made the flock wholly dependent upon human instrumentalities. But the days of purification of the church are hastening on apace. God will have a people pure and true.

He therefore sought to impress upon his brethren the importance of trying to help one another in love. He declared that all the requirements of the law setting forth our duty to our fellow-men are fulfilled in love to one another. He warned them that if they indulged hatred and strife, dividing into parties, and like the brutes biting and devouring one another, they would bring upon themselves present unhappiness and future ruin. There was but one way to prevent these terrible evils, and that was, as the apostle enjoined upon them, to “walk in the Spirit.” They must by constant prayer seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit, which would lead them to love and unity."},{"refcode_short":"T31 240.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 31, p. 240.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"A house divided against itself cannot stand.

During the journeying of Israel in the wilderness, the weary and feeble ones who had fallen behind the body of the people, were attacked and slain by the cowardly and cruel Amalekites. Afterward Israel made war with the Amalekites and defeated them. “And the Lord said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua; for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.” Again the charge was repeated by Moses just before his death, that it might not be forgotten by his posterity: “Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were come forth out of Egypt; how he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary, and he feared not God. ... Thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget it.”"},{"refcode_short":"T31 241.2","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 31, p. 241.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"If God thus punished the cruelty of a heathen nation, how must he regard those who, professing to be his people, will make war upon their own brethren who are worn and wearied laborers in his cause. Satan has great power over those who yield to his control. It was the chief priests and elders—the religious teachers of the people—that urged on the murderous throng from the Judgment Hall to Calvary. There are hearts today among the professed followers of Christ, inspired by the same spirit that clamored for the crucifixion of our Saviour. Let the workers of evil remember that to all their acts there is one witness, a holy, sin-hating God. He will bring all their works into Judgment, with every secret thing."},{"refcode_short":"T31 241.3","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 31, p. 241.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"“We that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edification. For even Christ pleased not himself.” As Christ has pitied and helped us in our weakness and sinfulness, so should we pity and help others. Many are perplexed with doubt, burdened with infirmities, weak in faith, and unable to grasp the unseen; but a friend whom they can see, coming to them in Christ's stead, can be as a connecting link to fasten their trembling faith upon God. Oh, this is a blessed work! Let not pride and selfishness prevent us from doing the good which we may do, if we will work in Christ's name, and with a loving, tender spirit."},{"refcode_short":"T31 242.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 31, p. 242.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"“Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.” Here, again, our duty is plainly set before us. How can the professed followers of Christ so lightly regard these inspired injunctions? Not long since I received a letter describing a circumstance in which a brother had manifested indiscretion. Although it occurred years ago, and was a very small matter, hardly worthy of a second thought, the writer stated that it had forever destroyed her confidence in that brother. If that sister's life should show, upon review, no greater errors, it would be indeed a marvel, for human nature is very weak. I have been and am still fellowshiping as brethren and sisters those who have been guilty of grave sins, and who even now do not see their sins as God sees them. But the Lord bears with these persons, and why should not I? He will yet cause his Spirit so to impress their hearts that sin will appear to them as it appeared to Paul, exceedingly sinful."},{"refcode_short":"T31 242.2","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 31, p. 242.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"We know but little of our own hearts, and have but little sense of our own need of the mercy of God. This is why we cherish so little of that sweet compassion which Jesus manifests toward us, and which we should manifest toward one another. We should remember that our brethren are weak, erring mortals, like ourselves. Suppose that a brother has through unwatchfulness been over-borne by temptation, and contrary to his general conduct has committed some error; what course shall be pursued toward him? We learn from Bible history that men whom God had used to do a great and good work committed grave sins. The Lord did not pass these by unrebuked, neither did he cast off his servants. When they repented, he graciously forgave them, and revealed to them his presence, and wrought through them. Let poor, weak mortals consider how great is their own need of pity and forbearance from God and from their brethren. Let them beware how they judge and condemn others. We should give heed to the instruction of the apostle: “Ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.” We may fall under temptation, and need all the forbearance which we are called to exercise toward the offender. “With what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.”"},{"refcode_short":"T31 243.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 31, p. 243.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The apostle adds a caution to the independent and self-confident: “If a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. ... Every man shall bear his own burdens.” He who considers himself superior in judgment and experience to his brethren, and despises their counsel and admonition, evinces that he is in a dangerous delusion. The heart is deceitful. He should test his character and life by the Bible standard. God's word sheds an unerring light upon the pathway of man's life. Notwithstanding the many influences which arise to divert and distract the mind, those who honestly seek God for wisdom will be guided into the right course. Every man must at last stand or fall for himself, not according to the opinion of the party that sustains or opposes him, not according to the judgment of any man, but according to his real character in the sight of God. The church may warn, counsel, and admonish, but it cannot compel any to take a right course. Whoever persists in disregarding the word of God must bear his own burden,—answer to God for himself, and suffer the consequences of his own course."},{"refcode_short":"T31 244.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 31, p. 244.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The Lord has given us in his word definite, unmistakable instructions, by obedience to which we may preserve union and harmony in the church. Brethren and sisters, are you giving heed to these inspired injunctions? Are you Bible-readers, and doers of the word? Are you striving to fulfill the prayer of Christ, that his followers might be one? “The God of patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus, that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God.” “Finally, brethren, be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace shall be with you.”"}]
