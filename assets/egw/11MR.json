Settle it in your hearts, that you are not on the earth to exalt self, to make a great name, but to sink self wholly out of sight in Jesus Christ. Let Jesus be lifted up. Let the great truths connected with the salvation of man be the theme of your meditation day and night. Your work, both by precept and example, is to hold forth the word of life, to seek with all your power to bring souls to the knowledge of the truth.—Letter 38, 1890, p. 8.

What has Jesus done for you? He has given His precious life for you. If God had not loved you He would have retained Jesus in heaven. “God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life” (John 3:16). Do not allow the enemy to crowd this out of your mind. It is the most important theme for your meditation. What have I done to show that I appreciate this great love? What have I given to Jesus? The gift that will be a precious and fragrant offering to Him will be yourself. You that have not made your decision to be sons and daughters of God, I beg of you to do this without any delay. Place your will on the side of God's will. He delights in mercy. “Who is a God like unto Thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of His heritage? He retaineth not His anger forever, because He delighteth in mercy” (Micah 7:18). Have you decided to become a part of the heritage of the Lord? “Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building” (1 Corinthians 3:9). Come to Jesus just as you are, weak and sinful, ignorant and unworthy and He will receive you. He says, “A new heart also will I give you” (Ezekiel 36:26)."},{"refcode_short":"11MR 364.1","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 11 [Nos. 851-920], p. 364.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Among the Jews was a remembrance made of sins every year, and they felt that sin needed a fresh sacrifice.

Will the youth think seriously and begin to inquire, What shall I do to be saved? “Behold! The Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world” (John 1:29). The more your mind is educated and trained to think of Jesus, to talk of Jesus, the less power will Satan have over your mind.

It was as our Redeemer that He came, that those who believe in Him may receive from Him the strength and the virtue that will enable them to overcome in the struggle with evil. For this reason the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us. As in Adam all die, even so, through accepting Christ as a personal Saviour, all may be alive. “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him” (John 3:36)."},{"refcode_short":"11MR 365.2","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 11 [Nos. 851-920], p. 365.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"To the astonishment of all heaven, the proclamation was made that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son to a life of humiliation and suffering.

He made an offering that could not possibly be exceeded in value. The love of God was manifested in and through Christ. The Son of God suffered the penalty of sin, reconciling the world unto Himself. He who knew no sin became a sin-offering, that fallen, sinful human beings, through repentance and confession, might receive pardon.

When the elder brother saw the joy that was expressed at the return of the prodigal, he felt that he was insulted; for he had never left his father's house.

Had they been faithful stewards of the sacred trust, the Lord would have delighted in His people, and would have made them the praise of the whole earth. But they transgressed the law, and broke the covenant of God. They had despised the riches of His goodness, His forbearance, His long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth to repentance, and in so doing they treasured up to themselves “wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; Who will render to every man according to his deeds: to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life: ... Not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified” (Romans 2:4-7, 13). The Jews were the chosen nation. They were favored with the oracles of God.
