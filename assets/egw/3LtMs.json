The capital stood upon a rock. On one side this rock was deemed inaccessible. They did not therefore place a guard there. The wily Gauls discovered a path by which it might be scaled, and in the dark nights with silent stealth, they climbed these crags. On they sped unseen. Deep were the slumbers of the Romans, vain the watchfulness of the sentinels. On, on the Gauls urged their way. They reached the summit. Very soon the unguarded Romans will perish! But no. God has a work for that ironhearted people to perform and choosing some birds, the sacred geese kept in their temple, as His instruments, they made unusual cackling. The Roman sentinel wonders, searches on all sides and discovers the foe in season to arouse his companions in arms, and hurl the adventurers down the steeps they had adventurously climbed.

But when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.” 1 John 3:1-2. Life! Life! should be manifested in every action.

God is dishonored by the loose way in which parents manage their children while at church. If children are taken into church, they should be taught obedience. The minister should instruct the people upon the government of children, and his own children should be examples of proper subjection. Your own deficiency upon this point is so apparent that I must urge upon you the necessity of prompt and immediate action."},{"refcode_short":"3LtMs, Lt 1, 1877, par. 13","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 3 (1876 - 1882), Lt 1, 1877, par. 13","content":"Dear _____, Christ is the pattern we are required to follow if we would meet the Bible standard.

I thought it would be better for him than to remain where his mind would be called out to have decisions to make and counsel to give. We prayed over this matter, he and I alone. I anointed him with oil and prayed for him an hour before we were to take the cars, and he consented to accompany us—Elder Smith, Sister Ings, to have a care for us, and myself."},{"refcode_short":"3LtMs, Lt 10a, 1877, par. 3","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 3 (1876 - 1882), Lt 10a, 1877, par. 3","content":"We felt on the journey that we were in the line of duty.

They have tasted of the same spirit of malice, of unreasonable opposition, from the First-Day Adventists.

If the parents are swept into the strong current of the world and follow its practices regardless of right or wrong, time or expense, certainly no better can be expected of their children. The lessons of precept and example given by parents to their children should tend to fit their characters for the higher, immortal life.

As the mighty Lifegiver is about to perform His crowning miracle, the faith of the afflicted ones fails them. Objections are urged, and objections presented.

A word from Christ would cast it into the depths of the sea; but He waits for man, finite man, to co-operate with Him to prepare the way. Jesus reasons with them, and again requests them to submit their will, and let Him help them in His own way. “Take ye away the stone” is the requirement which Christ has made, and which must be obeyed before Christ shall work for them. The stone is finally rolled away, Now man has done all that was required of him, and the way is prepared for Christ to do His work. The Prince of Life calls for death to give up its captive and permit this new subject to return to life. He commands. The dead obeys His voice, and Lazarus awakes to consciousness.

Determine that you will be a man after God’s own heart. Seek as earnestly to know the best means for securing the salvation of your fellow men as you have sought to acquire worldly treasure. A resolute purpose is sure to win the desired end."},{"refcode_short":"3LtMs, Lt 4, 1878","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 3 (1876 - 1882), Lt 4, 1878","content":"Lt 4, 1878"},{"refcode_short":"3LtMs, Lt 4a, 1878","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 3 (1876 - 1882), Lt 4a, 1878","content":"Lt 4a, 1878"},{"refcode_short":"3LtMs, Lt 4a, 1878, par. 1","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 3 (1876 - 1882), Lt 4a, 1878, par. 1","content":"I have just left Oakland for Healdsburg.

He looked upon Brother Healey as though he were too insignificant for him to spend his time upon. He stated he thought he was sent for to discuss with somebody, but he was mistaken. There was nobody to meet. He, in referring to Healey and Stevens, called them the beardless boys attempting to teach doctrines to gray-headed men who had preached before they were born. Johnson was so personal and impudent that it told against him. Healey was calm and gentlemanly.

Some of the people asked, “What have you brought this man here for—to disgrace the Christian church?” Johnson had no self-control, while Brother Healey was as calm as if chiseled out of marble; not a muscle of his face expressed his feelings. He was as pale as the dead, but perfectly self-possessed. While he was talking, Johnson would be walking, changing color, drinking copious draughts of water, and showing great excitement. Johnson would not keep to the Bible. He read spurious history and would not bring his evidence of the change of the Sabbath from the Bible because there was none there to bring. From first to last the truth was triumphant. Johnson found that the beardless boy was a match for him. Brother Healey referred him to the boasts of Goliath met by the stripling David.

But the letters written to Brother Glenn last summer by Father in reference to Edson, and the position taken by yourself to guard the office lest Edson should assume responsibilities, have been acted upon by Brother Glenn.

Not a word of this has been hinted to either of them. Edson is not making complaints. I listen to none. But I have had but one mind in these matters.

He has stated to Brother Gillet, when Lucinda has urged a change in some matters, that he will not be dictated to or controlled. He has a judgment of his own. Giving Brother Glenn absolute authority in that office has not been a wise and judicious thing, but it was difficult to tell what should be done under the circumstances.

Just as soon as one has a vivid and all-absorbing consciousness of his own personal accountability to God and of his duty to his fellow men, and senses that his influence is far-reaching, stretching into eternity, he will not be satisfied with a low standard, he will not be faultfinding and critical of others. He will make his own life what he would wish the lives of others to be. He will live only in Christ, utterly and wholly dependent on Him for every beauty and loveliness of character. This is the burden of my labor—to get the minds of the people away from envy, jealousy, evil surmising. I try to impress upon them their duty to answer in their own lives the prayer of Christ, that His disciples may be one, even as He is one with the Father. This blessed oneness, this unity of believers, is the credential we bear to the world that God has sent His Son. “That they may be one, even as We are one, that the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me.” [John 17:22, 21.] What joy would it bring to my heart if this sweet unity prevailed. If self would be overcome, all wrath, all bitterness, all malice, all contention and evil speaking be put away from Christ’s followers. Self wants the supremacy. Self is struggling for the mastery.

The most rigid economy should be used in this matter without stinginess. It is easier to run up a bill than to settle it. There are many things that would be convenient and enjoyable that is not needful and that can be dispensed with without actual suffering. It is very easy to run up hotel bills and car bills that might be avoided or be very much less.

In the place of following inclination, he did the will of God, however unpleasant and crucifying to his nature. The reason many in this age of the world make no greater advancement in the divine life is because they interpret their own will to be just what God wills. They do exactly as they desire and flatter themselves they are conforming to God’s will. They please self in everything and have no conflict with self. Many battle well at first against selfish desires for pleasure and ease. They are sincere and earnest, but grow weary of protracted effort of daily death, ceaseless turmoil with resisting Satan’s temptations, and indolence seems inviting, death to self repulsive, and [they] close the drowsy eyes and drop under temptation instead of resisting it.

He was elevated above the common affairs of the world, yet He did not exclude Himself from society. He dined with publicans and sinners, played with little children, and took them in His arms and blessed them. He graced the wedding feast with His presence. He shed tears at the grave of Lazarus. He was a lover of the beautiful in nature and used the lilies to illustrate the value of natural simplicity in the sight of God above artificial display. He used the occupation of the husbandman to illustrate the most sublime truths of the kingdom of God. His zeal never degenerated into passion nor His consistency into selfish obstinacy. His benevolence never savored of weakness nor His sympathy of sentimentalism. He combined the innocence and simplicity of the child with manly strength, all-absorbing devotion to God with tender love for man. He possessed commanding dignity, combined with winning grace of humility. He manifested unyielding firmness with sweet gentleness.

Lacking these essential qualifications, those who should accept the truth from his lips would follow an inferior standard, and his influence would not be a savor of life unto life. The right example must be given by the ministers of today for the new converts, the essentials of true godliness be impressed upon them every day, and the words and character of the minister make the correct impression on the minds of the young converts. He needs to be Christlike and so closely connected with God that the beauty of holiness will shine forth in his words and deportment. There are too many rushed recklessly into the ministry, unfitted for the work. Their standard is too low. They will never elevate others unless they have a deeper experience.

Their ideas and opinions must bear sway; their hearts are filled with selfishness; they are constantly exalting self and finding fault with others who are better than themselves. They pass censure and harsh judgment upon others, while their own course appears right in their own eyes. They put their hands to a work which God has not given them, but leave undone the work He has left for them to do, which is to take heed to themselves lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble the church and defile it. They turn their eyes outward to watch lest the character of others should not be right, when their eyes should be turned inward to scan and criticize their own actions, testing their feelings and motives by the law of God, the only standard of right, and emptying from the heart love of self, envy, evil surmising, jealousy, malice, unkindness, and self-esteem. When they do this, they will not be climbing upon the judgment seat and pronouncing sentence upon others who are in God’s sight better than they.

Oh, wondrous love, that should lead the Saviour to yield up His honor, His glory, His royal throne and royal court, and for our sakes become poor, that we through His poverty might be made rich! In order to secure us to Himself, and insure our eternal salvation, He gave all that He had—His riches, His glory, and His own precious life. For us He endured the agony of the garden of Gethsemane, when the mysterious cup trembled in His hand, and His anguished soul cried out, “Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me.” From His pale, quivering lips came this anguished prayer, and then the words of submission, “O My Father, if this cup may not pass away from Me except I drink it, Thy will be done.” [Matthew 26:39, 42.] An angel from heaven strengthened the royal Sufferer to tread His blood-stained path to Calvary, and to drink the cup of suffering to its very dregs. [Luke 22:43.] Oh, why was all this suffering, this ignominy, and torturing agony? It was that by this sacrifice of Himself His love might stand revealed, that He might woo men from the ways of sin. After man has cost so much, will He leave him now? Oh, no, no! He is faithful that has promised, His arms are outstretched to clasp the repentant, believing ones to His heart of love, with all the tenderness of divine affection.

Brother McDearmon for a time was the only one to wait upon his distressed family. Everything of temporal matters was necessarily neglected. These afflicted ones suffered for want of care or a cooling drink. The mother, who needed herself the tenderest care, was compelled to wait upon the sick, giving them the very best care she could in her feebleness. Brother McDearmon at length came down. Those of like faith were some of them sick, and those who were not sick did not offer their services in the suffering need, but, like the priest and Levite, passed by on the other side, fearing some burden would fall upon them. The eldest daughter had several relapses because she was compelled to leave her sickbed and do something for the other suffering ones.

These precious, faithful children of God were not left alone. Angels of God kept faithful vigils, and one after another they were able to arise from their beds of suffering.

He says, “I was an hungred, and ye gave Me no meat; ... I was ... naked and ye clothed Me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited Me not.” The answer comes back, “When saw we Thee thus and administered not unto Thee?” Said Christ, “Inasmuch as ye have not done it unto one of the least of these My servants, ye have not done it unto Me.” [Matthew 25:42-45.] Thus Christ shows that He identifies His interest with suffering humanity. A neglect of the duties due to suffering humanity whom Christ calls His brethren is a neglect of Himself in the person of His saints. Many seem willing to do some great work for the Master, but when He places directly before them work to do in the common duties of life, they will not accept it, but call for some greater work.

You shift the burden from your own shoulders, and let it drop upon those who fear not God and at heart regard not man. How much means has been obtained from you by fraud, you will never know.

The government of your temper is your own work. In whatever situation you may be placed, you will meet with much that will conflict with your feelings and put your disposition to a severe test.

There has been stepping in too deep improvements in printing house and in sanitarium and tabernacle. Just now all these improvements must be made, but not on borrowed [money]. These things have cost terribly, when less expensive arrangements would have shown economy and saved the reputation of our institutions. But there is a vein of pride that is running through all these things that is not pleasing to God. We needed a college, and it was in the providence of God that we should have one. We have not laid out too much in [the] college. We needed [a] sanitarium, and this was moving in the providence of God. But with the finances as they were, several thousand should have been saved in the mere matter of building, even if the show was not so great or pleasing. It will not answer to grow too fast and stretch clear beyond the measure of means, but make haste slowly and have less interest to pay. And it will not answer to let pride of heart control matters as it certainly is doing. We all need to have greater humility, or God will move the candlestick out of its place."},{"refcode_short":"3LtMs, Lt 8, 1879, par. 4","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 3 (1876 - 1882), Lt 8, 1879, par. 4","content":"Our foreign missions must not be hampered.

He stated in a meeting in the tent that he had tried again and again to leave off his gambling, but he could not. There was an infatuation about the game which would draw him irresistibly to the gambling table. When he heard this truth, he believed it was truth and embraced it. Then he was told Jesus was our Helper and if we prayed to Him, He would give strength to overcome all these bad habits.

It is his course and his influence that has shattered the nervous system of Sister Bourdeau so that her constitution is not what it might be. Sister Bourdeau is moulded too much by his strong spirit.

There is that selfishness about him that he fails to see and overcome. I believe Daniel wants to be a Christian, but he does not begin at his own heart to conform his life and character to the life and character of Christ. Self is mixed and mingled with everything he undertakes. Now these are the reasons that Brother Daniel will not be a fit man for Europe. These defects will be a hindrance to the work wherever he may labor, but in a new field where the people must be educated and moulded, where prejudices are strong, where obstacles to the people embracing the truth are many, these defects are tenfold more injurious.

We shall long for release and often become discouraged, and then we will, in view of the prizes of eternal life, arise again, gird on the armor anew, and toil on to gain the prize. Self-conquest, perfection of the heart, is nothing less than washing our robes of character and making them white in the blood of the Lamb. Thousands fail because they love ease, indulgence, and self-gratification.

They had no sympathy and union with those who were seeking to come up upon the broad platform of reform from a religious standpoint. But when those who had no sympathy for our faith showed interest in temperance, it was a sharp rebuke to those who had been privileged with great light and great opportunities and yet stubbornly refused to be reformed. A class of the same order as themselves, having a lower standard, has an influence upon them, [and] grasps the light requirements.

These questions were not asked, supposing that we could answer them, but to call our attention to the deep mysteries of God and to make men know that their wisdom is limited, that in the common things of daily life there are mysteries past the comprehension of finite minds, that the judgment and purposes of God are past finding out, His wisdom unsearchable.

He is not to be comprehended by man in His wisdom and reasons and purposes. “His ways are past finding out.” [Romans 11:33.] His love can never be explained upon natural principles. If this could be done, we would not feel that we could trust Him with the interests of our souls. Skeptics refuse to believe, because with their finite minds they cannot comprehend the infinite power by which God reveals Himself to men. Even the mechanism of the human body cannot be fully understood; it presents mysteries that baffle the most intelligent. Yet because human science cannot in its research explain the ways and works of the Creator, men will doubt the existence of God and ascribe infinite power to nature. God’s existence, His character, [and] His law are facts that all the reasoning of men of the highest attainments cannot controvert. They deny the claims of God and neglect the interest of their souls because they cannot understand His ways and works. Yet God is ever seeking to instruct finite men that they may exercise faith in Him and trust themselves wholly in His hands.

We met our beloved Sister Moor, whose society for years we have enjoyed in San Francisco. We were made very sad to see her sinking under a disease pronounced incurable. She was given over by physicians to die. She was a great sufferer. When I visited her at one time about five years ago in San Francisco, I asked her if she desired any one thing that we might present to the Lord. She replied, “Ask the Lord to remove this disagreeable, afflicting pain.” We presented the case to God and humbly asked Him to remove this pain and give relief to our sister. She related in our little meeting that the prayer was answered. The pain left her, and she had none of it since. Her dropsy had disappeared. By a miracle of God’s mercy, her life has been spared these five years in answer to the prayer of faith. My husband, before he left the coast five years since, administered to her at her bedside what he supposed was the last sacrament. The hand that passed to her the emblems of the broken body and spilled blood of our Lord and Saviour is folded quietly upon the breast in his last sleep until the trump of God shall call him forth from the tomb to immortal life.
