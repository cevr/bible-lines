And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of Him; for whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth. If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards and not sons.” [Hebrews 12:3-8.] The Lord does not allow those who are His children to go on frowardly in their own errors, following misconceived opinions.

Testimonies will be borne that will cause unbelievers to tremble, and with painful earnestness to inquire, “What must I do to be saved?” [Acts 16:30.] Will not men have less confidence in the words and suggestions of men who are not worked by the Spirit of God? Will they not search the Scriptures with intense earnestness, that they may know what God saith in His Word. The days in which we are living are emphatically the last days of this earth’s history. Shall we not, in view of what is written in the inspired Word, decide to work for God and eternity? All around us there are unconverted men and women.

And we talked this matter over, and we had a complete victory. These men came to Battle Creek, and everything they could pervert they perverted. And so they told all around that Elder White came into the pitched tent there with his arm right around a woman, and led her the whole length of the tent and seated her there. He told that, and they spread it all around, that Elder White was not a safe man. Well, my husband in his speech, said he, “I own to doing that very thing.

And one got on one side, and the other crawled over him onto the other side, and there they groaned and prayed and confessed right there. But what about that thunderbolt?

It is a false testimony; and in the name of the Lord, I want, if you can save the man, to save him. But do not justify him in the course of underhand grasping that has been carried on for years, that this should have to appear before the world.

One place is not to be worked over and over again, while other parts of God’s world are left barren and unworked. God’s only begotten Son gave His life as a propitiation for the sins of the whole world. He who knew no sin was made sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him. “Christ also hath loved us,” Paul writes, “and hath given Himself for an offering, and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor.” [Ephesians 5:2.] This He did that we may be all that He desires us to be—representatives of Him, living lives that reveal His fragrance of character, His purity of thought. He died that others, beholding Him, might be led to desire to be like Him—pure and undefiled, wholly acceptable to God, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing."},{"refcode_short":"20LtMs, Ms 185, 1905","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 20 (1905), Ms 185, 1905","content":"Ms 185, 1905"},{"refcode_short":"20LtMs, Ms 185, 1905, par. 1","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 20 (1905), Ms 185, 1905, par. 1","content":"Report of Interview with Drs.
