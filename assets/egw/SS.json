David knew that in order for Solomon to fulfill the trust with which God honored him, the youthful ruler must be not merely a warrior and statesman, but a good man, a teacher of righteousness, an example of fidelity. With earnestness David entreated Solomon to be noble, to show mercy to his subjects, and in all his dealings with the nations to honor the name of God and to manifest the beauty of holiness. “He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.” 2 Samuel 23:3."},{"refcode_short":"SS 13.3","refcode_long":"From Splendor to Shadow, p. 13.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In his youth Solomon made David's choice his own, and for many years his life was marked with strict obedience to God's commands.
