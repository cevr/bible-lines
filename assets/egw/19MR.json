You and your associates should humble your hearts before God and become as little children. “Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.” You are all very near and dear to my heart, but remember that in every trial you must hold firmly to the hand that was pierced for you. Often has the hand of God been stretched out to save you from peril, but when men have spoken words that were not inspired by the Spirit of God, you have felt disheartened. When unwise movements have been made in reference to you, my son, you have sometimes dropped the hand, the dear loving hand that was held out to save you, and you have grieved the heart of Jesus. This is why I write and caution you not to trust in men, or to make flesh your arm. You must make God alone your trust.

I cannot use it, but I can use my right eye. This is a strange experience for me in recent years. But in the early years of my work, I did much of the writing for my books with my left eye bandaged. And it may be that I shall again be afflicted in the same way. But I thank the Lord that for many years now I have been able to use both eyes."},{"refcode_short":"19MR 393.2","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 19 [Nos. 1360-1419], p. 393.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I am now writing on Old Testament history.

As the Lord's people show their determination to follow the light that the Lord has given, the enemy will bring all his powers to bear to discourage them. But they are not to give up because of the difficulties that arise when they try to follow the counsel of the Lord. God has given us His work to do, and if we comply with His requirements, we shall be blessed. The Lord has shown me that we shall have to meet experiences just such as have taken place."},{"refcode_short":"19MR 393.5","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 19 [Nos. 1360-1419], p. 393.5 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The enemy is actively at work, as you will see as you travel on his territory opening the Word of God to the people. As the last message of mercy is proclaimed by human lips, Satan will try to storm his way to the front, but he cannot prevail against Christ. As we present the truth that shows the people the evil of his delusions, his anger will be aroused, and he will do all in his power to hinder our efforts. But continue to present a “Thus saith the Lord,” remembering that God is your helper. Do not give the enemy the right of way."},{"refcode_short":"19MR 394.1","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 19 [Nos. 1360-1419], p. 394.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Satan would fill the world with commercialism, and he has succeeded in inducing some of our leading men to turn away from the light given by God.

But he allowed a desire for supremacy to take possession of him, and he was expelled from heaven. He came to this earth, and entered with great zeal into commercialism. And unless we stand loyal and true by the side of Prince Emmanuel, we shall be ensnared. Some of our ministers have been led astray because they would not follow the light that the Lord gave them.

The lives of many of those attempting these feats are sacrificed. It is not the God of heaven who leads men to attempt these hazardous feats. It is the god of this world whom they are serving.

Because he could not have it, he became desperate, rebelled, and was cast out of heaven. Because he was restrained from carrying out his plans, he decided that he would be his own God. He came to this world, and here he determined to do a great work through commercialism. He laid his plans to turn the world into a place where he could carry out his strange devisings. But the Lord forbade his plans.

Under the leadership of Satan there are men who today are doing all in their power to plunge the world into commercial strife. Thus Satan is trying to bring about a condition of things that will make the world uncivilized. He desires to see strange things acted out, which God, who is too wise to err, has not ordained. But the Lord—yes, our God—will be Ruler of the heavens and the earth. If men and women will carry out His requirements, it will be seen that He is Ruler, carrying out His divine will.—Letter 114, 1910."}]
