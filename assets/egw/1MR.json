Had He raised His voice to an unnatural key, as is customary with many preachers in this day, the pathos and melody of the human voice would have been lost, and much of the force of the truth destroyed...."},{"refcode_short":"1MR 22.1","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 1 [Nos. 19-96], p. 22.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In His discourses Christ did not bring many things before them at once, lest He might confuse their minds.

He, therefore, aroused their minds by presenting truth through the agency of their most familiar associations. He used illustrations in His teaching which called into activity their most hallowed recollections and sympathies, that He might reach the inner temple of the soul. Identifying Himself with their interests, He drew His illustrations from the great book of nature, using objects with which they were familiar. The lily of the field, the seed sown by the sower, the springing up of the seed, and the harvesting of the grain, the birds of the air,—all these figures He used from which to present divine truth; for those would remind them of His lessons whenever they should afterward look upon them.—Manuscript 25, 1890, 4-6.

If souls a month or two old in the truth, who are about to enter the time of trouble such as never was, cannot hear all the straight truth, or endure the strong meat of the straightness of the way, how will they stand in the day of battle? Truths that we have been years learning must be learned in a few months by those who now embrace the Third Angel's Message.

But now the truth is plain; its rays are brought together. The blazing light of truth when it is presented as it should be can be now seen and brought to bear upon the heart. There is no need of milk after souls are convinced of the truth. As soon as the conviction of truth is yielded to and the heart willing, the truth should have its effect, the truth will work like leaven, and purify and purge away the passions of the natural heart. It is a disgrace for those who have been in the truth for years to talk of feeding souls who have been months in the truth, upon milk.

His greatness and power in God's world would have their day, and a second kingdom would arise, which also would have its period of trial as to whether it would exalt the one Ruler, the only true God. Not doing this, its glory would fade away, and a third kingdom would occupy its place. Proved by obedience or disobedience, this also would pass away; and a fourth, strong as iron, would subdue the nations of the world.

He is to show the power and authority of His voice to those who have united with Satan to oppose the truth. After these seven thunders uttered their voices, the injunction comes to John as to Daniel in regard to the little book: “Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered” (Revelation 10:4). These relate to future events which will be disclosed in their order. Daniel shall stand in his lot at the end of the days. John sees the little book unsealed. Then Daniel's prophecies have their proper place in the first, second, and third angels’ messages to be given to the world. The unsealing of the little book was the message in relation to time."},{"refcode_short":"1MR 99.2","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 1 [Nos. 19-96], p. 99.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The books of Daniel and the Revelation are one. One is a prophecy, the other a revelation; one a book sealed, the other a book opened. John heard the mysteries which the thunders uttered, but he was commanded not to write them. The special light given to John which was expressed in the seven thunders was a delineation of events which would transpire under the first and second angels’ messages. It was not best for the people to know these things, for their faith must necessarily be tested. In the order of God, most wonderful and advanced truths would be proclaimed. The first and second angels’ messages were to be proclaimed, but no further light was to be revealed before these messages had done their specific work. This is represented by the angel standing with one foot on the sea, proclaiming with a most solemn oath that time should be no longer."},{"refcode_short":"1MR 100.1","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 1 [Nos. 19-96], p. 100.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"This time which the angel declares with a solemn oath, is not the end of this world's history, neither of probationary time, but of prophetic time, which should precede the advent of our Lord.

The longest reckoning reaches to the autumn of 1844. The angel's position with one foot on the sea, the other on the land signifies the wide extent of the proclamation of the message. It will cross the broad waters and be proclaimed in other countries, even to all the world. The comprehension of truth, the glad reception of the message is represented in the eating of the little book.

God's countless mercies are enjoyed, His benefits appropriated, and there is on the part of the worldling no recognition of the Giver, no expression of gratitude for the manifold goodness of God.

The apostle says, “With the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation” (Romans 10:10). What then is the difference between a Christian and a man whose heart is not brought under the controlling influence of the spirit of God? One is fallen upon the Rock and is broken; self is dead, and Jesus lives in him and molds and fashions him according to His own divine image. His connection with God is made manifest in his business transactions and in all the affairs of life, whether great or small; for he keeps the way of the Lord. His affections and hopes are not centered upon the things of this life, but they are set upon things above. The selfish one lives for self, and he seeks worldly honor, worldly gain; he will make it manifest that his hopes are centered upon the things of earth.

When the heart is not in possession of an indwelling Saviour, the carnal lusts, the tastes, the mind of the great deceiver will be revealed in the life, and although men may make a profession of Christianity, their works will testify that they know not God; though they acknowledge the truth, its place in the heart is occupied by a deceptive spirit. The love of the Saviour is not there. The love of Christ was an unselfish love, that prompted Him to seek and save that which was lost. Those who think much of their remuneration for their services, reveal the fact that they have not laid the foundation for their spiritual life on the sure Rock, or they have lost the spirit of the truth, and have forgotten that they are purged from the old leaven with the priceless blood of the Son of God. They have become so devoid of spiritual discernment that they place the sacred and the common on the same level.

The Lord has opened a place for you in the food factory. He has blessed you and has given you tact and understanding for the work. Until you have positive evidence that it is your duty to change your position, remain where you are. You are blessed above many youth: for you have the society of your mother, while so many are forced to be separated from home influences."},{"refcode_short":"1MR 393.3","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 1 [Nos. 19-96], p. 393.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I am impressed by the Lord to say to you, my youthful brother, that someone must do the work you are doing. In the position in which you are placed you have been obtaining the best experience a young man can have. The Lord desires to have, in connection with this institution, men and women who love and fear Him. Those who are engaged in the work of preparing health foods are just as much in the service of God as if they were in the dentistry business or in the medical missionary work.

Learn all you can in the work in which you are engaged. The Lord knows what His people need, and through His chosen agents He manifests His benevolence to men; for He is ever working for the happiness of those who love and serve Him.... God desires us to find out how we may be of real service to Him. We must keep looking to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith. The law which He has given us to obey is the best expression of His love.

I was assured that if we lost our first love, Jesus would not, could not, bless us with His counsel; that if we took upon us responsibilities in our own strength, and exercised our own judgment, we should be left to our own wisdom, which is foolishness. We were to work in God; to keep all our spiritual faculties alive; to keep ourselves under the steady, invigorating beams of the Sun of Righteousness; for Christ has said, “Without Me ye can do nothing” (John 15:5)."},{"refcode_short":"1MR 395.2","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 1 [Nos. 19-96], p. 395.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"And God was with us. As prosperity attended the publishing work, the wages were increased, as they should be. While I was in Switzerland, word came to me from Battle Creek that a plan had been formed by which none working in the office should receive more than twelve dollars per week. I said, “This will not work; it will be a necessity for some to receive higher wages than this.” But double this amount should not be rewarded to any man connected with the office; for if a few take from the treasury so largely, justice cannot be shown to all. Large wages afforded to the few is the world's plan; while others in every way as deserving receive far less. This is not justice."},{"refcode_short":"1MR 395.3","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 1 [Nos. 19-96], p. 395.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The Lord will have faithful men who love and fear him connected with every school, every printing office, health institution and publishing house. Their wages should not be fashioned after the worldling's standard. There should be, as far as possible, excellent judgment exercised to keep up, not an aristocracy, but an equality, which is the law of heaven, “All ye are brethren” (Matthew 23:8). A few should not demand large wages, and such wages should not be presented as an inducement to secure ability and talents. This is placing things on a worldly principle. The increase of wages brings with it a corresponding increase of selfishness, pride, display, self-gratification and needless extravagance that the people who do their utmost to pay their tithes and present their offerings to God do not have. Poverty is seen in all their borders. The Lord loves the ones just as much as the other, with the exception that the self-sacrificing, humble, contrite souls who love God and strive to serve Him, are ever kept nearer to the great heart of infinite love than the man who feels at liberty to have all the good things of this life.—Manuscript 25a, 1891, pp. 5,6.
