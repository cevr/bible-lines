This sacred mission has challenged members and leaders alike. In the early days of the movement, pioneers struggled to raise means and methods to spread the message.

To save these wandering ones He left the honors and glories of His Father’s house.

Their predictions that religious intolerance would gain control in the United States, that church and state would unite to persecute those who keep the commandments of God, have been pronounced groundless and absurd. It has been confidently declared that this land could never become other than what it has been—the defender of religious freedom. But as the question of enforcing Sunday observance is widely agitated, the event so long doubted and disbelieved is seen to be approaching, and the third message will produce an effect which it could not have had before.—GC 605 (1911)"},{"refcode_short":"PCL 307.2","refcode_long":"Principles for Christian Leaders, p. 307.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"As we near the time when principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness in high places will be brought into warfare against the truth, when the deceiving power of Satan will be so great that if it were possible he will deceive the very elect, we must have our discernment sharpened by divine enlightenment, that we may know the spirit that is of God, that we may not be ignorant of Satan’s devices.

Then the church will possess divine vitality throughout. The weak shall be as David, and David as the angel of the Lord.
