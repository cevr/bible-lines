It is only as we follow Christ with fidelity that we can do the work essential to be done to prepare a people to meet their Lord. The more men pray and believe and follow the directions of the Lord, the more perfectly will they use their talents in the accomplishment of His work. Men may accept a form of religion, but if pride, selfishness, and self-indulgence unite them with the world and its pleasures and amusements, their religion makes them worse instead of better; for they travel the broad road with a false sense of religious security. “He that will come after me,” Christ declared, “let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily and follow me.” [Luke 9:23.]"},{"refcode_short":"15LtMs, Lt 30, 1900, par. 8","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 15 (1900), Lt 30, 1900, par. 8","content":"There are professedly pious men who screen the sinner by their own transgression.

The interpretation of men is not needed to make the Word of God plain. Too often their interpretation confuses the mind. Men make of none effect the commandments of God by their traditions, teaching for doctrine the commandments of men. Let us have more Bible reading and less story reading. All may know how to understand what saith the Lord in regard to the gift of life in Christ Jesus. The Bible contains the science of salvation. “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.” [2 Timothy 3:16, 17.]"},{"refcode_short":"15LtMs, Lt 76, 1900, par. 7","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 15 (1900), Lt 76, 1900, par. 7","content":"The teachings of the Old Testament Scriptures are the words of Christ, spoken in plain, simple language.

The heart is the reservoir of the blood which circulates through the whole machinery, and through the blood the food is assimilated to the nourishment of the body, thus preserving and maintaining its usefulness. The food supplies the blood, and the air—the fresh, pure air of heaven—should be freely taken into the lungs, for it is constantly vivifying and purifying the blood current which circulates through the body. The blood may be starved by not taking sufficient nourishing food to carry forward its work, and the quality of the blood changes in its dispensary work throughout all parts of the human system. The life of the flesh is the blood. If the blood is not receiving the pure, vital air to purify it, and sufficient food is nourish and enrich it, [it cannot properly] do its marvelous work as it circulates through arteries, capillaries, and veins to every portion of the human building, repairing the bodily waste and cherishing the bodily growth."},{"refcode_short":"15LtMs, Lt 204, 1900, par. 5","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 15 (1900), Lt 204, 1900, par. 5","content":"I will say no more upon this point, because you are too feeble to take it in, but it becomes one who ought to be teachable to regard the advice and counsel of others.

You have pledged yourself to fulfill your obligations to your children, and the fact that you have been baptized in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is an assurance that these powers will help you in every emergency, if you will claim their help. The Lord will hear and answer the prayers of His sincere followers, who wear Christ’s yoke and learn in His school His meekness and lowliness of heart. The obligations in the spiritual agreement entered into at baptism are mutual.

His business is that of a tester of wool. He has skill and understanding in trading in wool. He commenced business on his own account and did well. Then other firms wished him to take their means and invest in wool. He did this, receiving ten pounds per week. Then this firm where he had been employed wanted him back. He gave a decided refusal, but said he would work for them in taking their money and purchasing for them. They placed in his hands six hundred pounds. He found a good chance, and invested eight hundred pounds. This brought to his employer double, yes, triple, his money value. But he trades for many firms, and his wages are often twenty pounds per week. His employer now sees his mistake and urges him to come back; but he will not go. He gave one hundred and twenty-five dollars to the expense of the camp meeting, and twenty pounds for the sanitarium, and he will be able to do something large in the putting up of a church building in West Geelong.
