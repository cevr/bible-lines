In Mrs. White's experience this period is opened and closed with trips from her home in St. Helena, California, to the East to attend important meetings. For the denomination it is a time of full recovery from the crisis of 1902-03 and of extending the work, of launching new enterprises, and of establishing new institutions."},{"refcode_short":"9T 3.2","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 3.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Following important meetings in Michigan in the spring of 1904, Mrs. White visited the South and then made her way to Washington, D. C., where steps were being taken to provide buildings for the work which was being established at the nation's capital. There was a new headquarters building to be erected, the Review and Herald must be provided with a home, a sanitarium was to be built, and a college established. The fact that Mrs. White made her home in Washington for some months, where she could give counsel regarding the work, as these four enterprises were gotten under way, was a great encouragement to the workers. It also exerted a far-reaching influence throughout the denomination in establishing the confidence of the church members that God had led in the transfer of the administration and publishing interests to the nation's capital."},{"refcode_short":"9T 3.3","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 3.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"This was a period of rapid advancement in the development of our medical work on the Pacific Coast. Sanitariums were opened in National City, Glendale, and Loma Linda, California. From the first, Loma Linda seemed destined to become a training center for medical workers at some future time to do the work for the denomination begun at Battle Creek. During the critical years of the establishment of the medical college, Mrs. White made frequent visits to Southern California, where she could give personal counsel and encouragement, and could assist in the laying of plans for the advancing work. It was utterances, based upon the revelations given her of God, that led us step by step eventually to the establishment of a fully recognized medical college. So insurmountable were the obstacles that, had it not been for the faith and confidence inspired by the frequent counsels which came through the spirit of prophecy, the enterprise would never have survived."},{"refcode_short":"9T 4.1","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 4.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"These important interests that took Mrs. White much from her home and her writing, resulted in a great delay in the issuance of books she hoped could soon be in the field doing their work. The Ministry of Healing was the only Ellen G. White book newly issued during this five-year period."},{"refcode_short":"9T 4.2","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 4.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The work of the denomination had by this time grown too large for us to mention in detail the various advance steps. The message was now belting the globe, missionaries were being sent out in increasing numbers, more institutions devoted to educational, publishing, and medical interests were being established. The message was truly reaching the ends of the earth."},{"refcode_short":"9T 4.3","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 4.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"It brought great rejoicing to the heart of Ellen White to meet with the representatives of the world-wide work as they gathered in Washington, D. C., in the spring of 1909 for the General Conference session. This was her last trip East—this the last General Conference session she attended. She was now eighty-one years of age and had given a long life of service to the cause of God. She had seen the work grow from the struggling beginning days when there were only a handful who kept the Sabbath and who looked for the soon coming of the Lord. Now they numbered 85,000, and there were 1,200 ordained and licensed ministers. As Ellen White stood before the General Conference, she was led to speak on certain subjects of great importance which must be reviewed. Among these was health reform. For forty-five years she had led out in teaching the great principles of healthful living which had been presented to her in vision. She had seen the fruitage of this teaching. However, there were some who still held back, there were some who were inclined to extremes, and so she reviewed our position and teachings point by point. This statement made before the General Conference forms an important chapter of volume 9."},{"refcode_short":"9T 5.1","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 5.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Another topic upon which she chose to speak was that of the medical college of Loma Linda.

This important statement is also a part of volume 9."},{"refcode_short":"9T 5.2","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 5.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Mrs. White had seen the work of the administration of the church develop from a committee of three which was appointed in 1863 to take charge of the General Conference, to its present status of organization with General Conference departments and with Division and Union Conference organizations dividing the responsibilities among hundreds who carried the burden of the work in various parts of the world field. In her closing words she pleaded for unity and consecration. In her written statements she dealt with the authority of the General Conference and the importance of the actions taken by the General Conference in full session. She wrote of the distribution of responsibility and the need of humility and of faith. These counsels form an important part of the closing section of volume 9."},{"refcode_short":"9T 5.3","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 5.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"At the turn of the century Mrs. White had begun to appeal for a renewed interest in the evangelizing of the millions in the great metropolitan centers of the world. These needs had been emphasized again and again in the counsels which had been sent to the leading workers. In response to these messages, interests in city work was revived. Large centers were entered. Many evangelistic efforts were held, old churches were strengthened, and new churches were established. To preserve the appeals for this work and the counsels as to its conduct in permanent form, an entire section of volume 9 is devoted to this important subject."},{"refcode_short":"9T 6.1","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 6.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"We were in days, too, when the various enterprises which were entered into called for the talents and energies of our lay members. It began to be clear that this work could never be finished unless the laity vigorously united with the ministry in carrying the message to the world. The work of laymen took on new importance. In the last two volumes of the Testimonies increasing emphasis had been placed upon the work of the laymen, and this is brought to a climax in volume 9. Following a picture of the last crisis and events to take place in the closing scenes of earth's history, several chapters are devoted to the call for every Seventh-day Adventist to take an active part in evangelism, in home missionary work, and in the circulation of literature."},{"refcode_short":"9T 6.2","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 6.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"There were two other lines of detailed counsel which are represented in this volume for the first time in the Testimonies, though considerable instruction had been given through the years relating to them. The first has to do with the work among the colored people. The second has to do with the religious liberty work. It was largely in response to the appeals made by Ellen White in the articles in the Review in the middle nineties that workers and laymen pushed into the great Southland and began their ministry, some in educational lines, some in medical lines, some in preaching the message, and others in quietly living the message as homes were established in regions which had not yet received the light. Still others had joined in this work in response to the appeals in volume 7. The workers faced many problems. Plans must be laid for advancement. New issues must be met, especially those relating to the work where there was race antagonism. Through the critical years counsel had been given which served as safe guidance for the work, and to make this counsel a permanent record to serve the church, it was included in volume 9."},{"refcode_short":"9T 7.1","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 7.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The religious liberty work was a line of endeavor in which we had been engaged for many years. Some were inclined to take extreme positions urging that true Sabbathkeeping meant that one must make it prominent to those about him that we labored on Sunday. In some regions this led to persecution. The Lord in his goodness sent messages to this people to give us a balanced conception of questions of this kind. These, too, appear in this volume in the section entitled, “The Religious Liberty Work,” opening with the chapter, “A Time of Trial Before Us,” and closing with the chapter, “Words of Caution.” So volume 9, drawing together counsels new and old, reiterating certain lines of instruction, giving details of counsel in other lines, encouraging to service, pointing out the dangers of extremes, leading to confidence in organization and pointing to the reward of earnest effort, became the cap-sheaf of the Testimonies for the Church."},{"refcode_short":"9T 7.2","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 7.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The work of Ellen White did not close with the issuance of Testimonies for the Church, Volume 9. Addressing herself more closely to her work of book preparation during the succeeding five years, she brought out Acts of the Apostles in 1911 and Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students in 1913.

The steady progress of the cause around the world was marked by this now aging messenger of the Lord residing among the quiet hills of northern California. Although she knew her labors were nearly finished, she had no fears for the future of the work of God, for as she stated: “whether or not my life is spared, my writings will constantly speak, and their work will go forward as long as time shall last.”—Writing and Sending out of the “Testimonies for the Church,” Pages 13, 14."},{"refcode_short":"9T 8.1","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 8.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"As plans were laid for the General Conference session of 1913, Mrs. White would have been pleased to have attended, but in her advancing age this seemed inadvisable. Not being able to present an oral message, she wrote two communications to be read to the delegates and church members assembled. In the second message, which was read by the president of the General Conference to the conference in session on the morning of May 27, she reviewed the experience of past years, and rejoiced in the marked evidences that God had led his people. Then, looking ahead, she called for renewed efforts in soul-saving work and appealed again for the unwarned cities.

The enemy is seeking to becloud the discernment of God's people, and to weaken their efficiency, but if they will labor as the Spirit of God shall direct, He will open doors of opportunity before them for the work of building up the old waste places.

Satan has come down with great power to work with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; and everything that can be shaken will be shaken, and those things that cannot be shaken will remain. The Lord is coming very soon, and we are entering into scenes of calamity. Satanic agencies, though unseen, are working to destroy human life. But if our life is hid with Christ in God, we shall see of His grace and salvation. Christ is coming to establish His kingdom on the earth. Let our tongues be sanctified and used to glorify Him. Let us work now as we have never worked before. We are exhorted to “be instant in season, out of season.” 2 Timothy 4:2. We are to make openings for the presentation of the truth. We are to improve every opportunity of drawing souls to Christ."},{"refcode_short":"9T 63.1","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 63.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"As a people we are to be reconverted, our lives sanctified to declare the truth as it is in Jesus.
