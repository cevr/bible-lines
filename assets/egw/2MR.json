The people who claim to believe that they have the last message of mercy to give the world are attracted by worldly fashions, and make great exertions to follow them as far as they think their profession of faith allows them to go.

When I see those who have named the name of Christ aping the fashions introduced by worldlings, I have the most painful reflections. Their lack of Christlikeness is apparent to all.

Frequently the trimmings of a dress cost more than the material for the dress itself. We warn our Christian sisters against the tendency to make their dresses according to worldly styles, thus attracting attention.

Precious time is wasted in keeping pace with ever-changing and never-satisfying fashions. No sooner is one style introduced, than new styles are devised, and then, in order for fashionable persons to remain fashionable, the dress must be remodeled.

By dressing simply, thus saving time and means, Christian women can do more to encourage and sustain the cause of temperance than by anything else.

Brother Rupert confessed also, and we had a very profitable, excellent meeting. Brother Smith has fallen on the Rock and is broken, and the Lord Jesus will now work with him. He took my hand as he left the room and said, “If the Lord will forgive me for the sorrow and burdens I have brought upon you, I tell you this will be the last. I will stay up your hands. The testimonies of God shall hold this place in my experience.” It is seldom that Elder Smith sheds a tear, but he did weep, and his voice was choked with the tears in it. Now you see I have reason to be glad and rejoice and praise the Lord. Professor Bell was present. Elder Smith confessed to him the wrong that he had done him in the school trial in 1882.

The Bible may be studied as a branch of human science would be, but its beauty, the evidence of its power to save the soul that believes, is a lesson that is never thus learned. If the practice of the Word is not brought into the life, then the sword of the Spirit has not wounded the natural heart. It has been shielded in poetic fancy. Sentimentalism has so wrapped it about that the heart has not sufficiently felt the keenness of its edge, piercing and cutting away the sinful shrines where self is worshiped. “For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart” [Hebrews 4:12].—Manuscript 64, 1895, 3.

No man, it was stated, obliged another to pay tithes. God did not make it a matter of compulsion any more than He compelled men to keep the Sabbath. It was God's Sabbath, His holy time, and to be sacredly regarded by man.

First, every licentiate should be critically examined in his knowledge of the Scriptures before being sent into the field to teach others. This has not been done, and a very unsuccessful work has been done by many and they could bring in no report of success.

We did not want to take out these trees altogether, so Brother Connell puts a rope around his body and after fastening a long ladder about the tree firmly, climbs the ladder, then climbs the straight, smooth trunk until he reaches a limb.

When he supposes the tree is cut enough, he goes down and the rope is securely fastened low around a strong tree. Then several lay hold of the rope, and down comes the tall top, leaving a pole—the trunk—about thirty feet high. This will soon put out new branches, low, which will give shade without any danger from the high, heavy top.

Christ's prayer answers this point: “I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.” While our work is aggressive, it must be conducted on Bible principles. All our enterprises are to be carried forward with Christlike simplicity, patience, forbearance, and love for God and for Christ. Our work is to convince, not to condemn.

The Jews had an appointed guard whose duty it was to watch the temple night and day, and although the guard was made up of a large number of men, each one felt that he was under obligation to stand in his lot and place, for he was entrusted with a solemn charge. Suppose that the numerous body of guards had been dismissed, and the whole burden of responsibility had been placed upon one man, and that at a time when particular danger was near because of the efforts of a vigilant foe. This would be presumption. Would not the solitary guard be liable to be overcome because overcharged? Thank God, important interests are not to rest on one man's mind or one man's judgment. Every soul is to be on the alert to catch every sound, to note every movement on the part of the enemy that would endanger his God-given charge. This is the spirit that should characterize every worker at the Health Retreat, for each one of you are entrusted with a sacred responsibility that you may help one another, strengthen one another in keeping the fort.

He could not look upon the angel's face, and he had no strength; it was all gone. So the angel came to him and set him upon his knees. He could not behold him then. And then the angel came to him with the appearance of a man. Then he could bear the sight."},{"refcode_short":"2MR 349.1","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 2 [Nos. 97-161], p. 349.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Why is it that so many claim to be holy and sinless? It is because they are so far from Christ. I have never dared to claim any such a thing. From the time that I was fourteen years old, if I knew what the will of God was, I was willing to do it. You never have heard me say I am sinless. Those that get sight of the loveliness and exalted character of Jesus Christ, who was holy and lifted up and His train fills the temple, will never say it. Yet we are to meet with those that will say such things more and more, every year.—Manuscript 5, 1885, 8-9. (“Hearing and Doing,” Sermon at Santa Rosa, March 7, 1885.)"}]
