I have never met a people yet that have intelligence as these have who are completely blinded as to their spiritual state before God. They cannot distinguish [that] there is any difference between the messengers the Lord sends and messages of reproof He gives them to bear, than the tirade they give to one and another who do not please them. Oh, how Satan triumphs to see such satanic attributes developed in those who flatter themselves that they have a high moral standing before God and are peculiarly better than the average mortals in the world.

Not that one grace is to be added after another, but all are to be manifest in the Christian character. “For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall be neither barren nor unfruitful.” “Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things (adding constantly to the graces here mentioned), ye shall never fall. For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.” [2 Peter 1:8, 10, 11.] Here is a life-insurance policy in which there can be no failure, for it is from the God of heaven.

A man with such a character will only make heaven miserable, because he, himself is miserable. “Except ye be born again,” said Christ, “Ye cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.” [John 3:3, 5, 7.] To enter heaven, a man must have Christ formed within, the hope of glory, and take heaven with him. The Lord Jesus alone can fashion and change the character. For want of patience, kindness, forbearance, unselfishness, and love, the revealings of the traits flash forth involuntarily when off guard, and unchristian words, un-Christlikeness of character burst forth, sometimes to the ruin of a soul. “Rejoiceth not in iniquity.” [1 Corinthians 13:6.] Mark it. The Apostle meant [that] where there is a cultivation of genuine love for precious souls, it will be exhibited for those most in need of that patience which suffereth long and is kind, and will not be ready to magnify a small indiscretion or direct wrong into large, unpardonable offenses, and will not make capital of others’ misdoings. The love for souls for whom Christ died to save will not do that which has been [done] through misconceptions of that which was due to the erring—expose their errors and weakness before a whole school. How do you think Jesus has looked upon such transactions? Should He have been present, He would have said to those doing these things, “Ye know not the Scriptures or the power of God” [Mark 12:24], for in the Scriptures are plainly marked how to deal with the erring. Forbearance, kindly consideration, “Consider thyself lest thou also be tempted,” would meet the stubborn, obdurate heart. [Galatians 6:1.] Love of Jesus will cover a multitude of sins, that they shall not prey upon the offender, neither be exposed to create feelings of every stripe and character in the human breast of those to whom these things, errors, mistakes, are laid open, and to the one thus dealt with. He is too often driven to desperation. His mind is beyond healing. Now, the work is to have the grace of Christ in the soul which will never, never be guilty of exposings another’s wrongs, unless it is a positive necessity. Practice the line of Christ. The True Witness speaks in Revelation 2:1-5. Practice love. There is nothing in Christianity that is capricious."},{"refcode_short":"8LtMs, Lt 50, 1893, par. 11","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 8 (1893), Lt 50, 1893, par. 11","content":"If a man will not exercise his arm, it becomes weak and deficient in muscular strength. Unless the Christian exercises his spiritual powers, he acquires no strength of character, no moral vigor. Love is a very precious plant and must be cultivated if it flourishes. The precious plant of love is to be treated tenderly, and it will become strong and vigorous and rich in fruit-bearing, giving expression to the whole character. A Christlike nature is not selfish, not unkind, will not hurt the souls of those who are struggling with Satan’s temptations. They will enter into the feelings [of those] that are tempted, that the trials and temptations shall be so managed as to bring out the gold and consume the dross. This is the practice which God appoints you. In this, Christ’s school, you may learn your lessons daily, and teachers and pupils are to be patient, humble, generous, noble. You will have to seek God most earnestly in prayer mingled with living faith, and the molding hand of God will bring out His own image in your character. Temptations will come, but [will] not overcome. Through grace found in opening the heart to the knock and voice of Jesus, Christian character and experience is growing more and more beautiful and heavenly. Let us bear in mind that we are dealing with souls that Christ has purchased with infinite cost to Himself. O, tell the erring, “God loves you, God died for you.” Weep over them, pray with them. Shed tears over them, but do not get angry with them. They are Christ’s purchased possession. Let every one seek a character that will express love in all their actions. “Whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.” [Matthew 18:6.] It were better not to live than to exist day by day devoid of that love which Christ has revealed in His character and has enjoined upon His children, “Love one another as I have loved you.” [John 13:34.]"},{"refcode_short":"8LtMs, Lt 50, 1893, par. 12","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 8 (1893), Lt 50, 1893, par. 12","content":"We live in a hard, unfeeling, uncharitable world.

If we wish to do good to souls, our success with these souls will be in proportion to their belief of our belief and appreciation of them. Respect shown to the struggling human soul is the sure means through Christ Jesus of the restoration of the self-respect the man has lost. Our advancing ideas of what he may become is a help we cannot ourselves fully appreciate. We have need of the rich grace of God every hour, then we will have a rich practical experience, for God is love. He that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God. Give love to them that need it most, the most unfortunate, those who have the most disagreeable temperaments need our love, our tenderness, our compassion; those who try our patience most need love. We pass through the world only once; any good thing we can do, we should do most earnestly, untiringly, with the same spirit as is stated of Christ in His work. He will not fail nor be discouraged. The rough, stubborn, sullen dispositions are the ones who need help the most. How can they be helped? Only by that love practiced in dealing with them as Christ revealed to fallen man. Treat them, you say, as they deserve. What if Christ had treated us thus. He the undeserving was treated as we deserve. Still we are treated by Christ with grace and love as we did not deserve, but as He deserved. Treat some characters as they, you think, richly deserve, and you will cut off from them the last thread of hope, spoil your influence, and ruin the soul. Will it pay? Now I say, No, a hundred times no. Bind these souls who need all the help it is possible for you to give them close to a loving, sympathizing, pitying heart over-flowing with Christlike love, and you will save a soul from death and hide a multitude of sins.

He earns three pounds per week as a tailor. He has hens and chickens that he keeps; the mother feeds these, and he does not want her to leave now. He did at one point of time, but her children, I think, do not respect their mother as they should and told her they would not give her a home with them. Brother Mountain took her into his family, but he says he had quite a severe trial of it, and when he found her children were abundantly able to support her, he took her back to them and let them have the burden, placing it where it belongs. Brother Mountain did not feel that Brother Anderson understood what he was entering into.

There are many honest souls here who long for the revival of the Spirit of God. They feel the dearth of the Spirit of God. God means the banner of truth shall be uplifted here.

He will open ways for us and His salvation will be revealed. I think if we just hold on by faith, and walk humbly with God, we will see a church raised up here.

I am sure he has not overcome his inclinations to dishonesty. I wish he could be connected with some of our people who have authority and influence, to do him good. I pity the young man. He has gone wrong and will go wrong continually if he is not yoked up with stable, firm-principled young men, or old, who can be constantly educating him in the right direction.

I do know this young man has most excellent traits of character, but he has failings which are constantly like the dead fly in the ointment. It spoils the whole.

He is always waiting at your door, always knocking for admittance. Let Him in. All you have to do is to put your will over on the Lord’s side. You need the promise, but it is the infinite One behind the promise in whom you are to have perfect confidence. Say it: “I am the Lord’s. I do believe.” Crowd out every doubt from the soul. Have faith in God. He loves you. Never, never allow yourself to doubt or distrust Him. He will take your burdens if you will let Him have them, and will give you peace which is the peace of Christ."},{"refcode_short":"8LtMs, Ms 80, 1893, par. 91","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 8 (1893), Ms 80, 1893, par. 91","content":"I have had a precious night’s rest.

If having a position of prominence makes men self-sufficient, if it encourages them to yield to temptation, if they become self-serving, and look out for their own advantage, ready to be bought or sold for gain, they will not long be entrusted with the work of God. Those who are covetous will defile the work of God by avarice. They will manifest the disposition that made the Lord abhor his people anciently.

From selfish motives, to avoid punishment, many would exercise great care in keeping the letter of the law, who now seem unmoved by entreaties, exhortations, warnings and prayers; for they do not make permanent reformation. But although punishment is delayed for a time, yet it will come, for the Lord has declared, “Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him: but it shall not be well with the wicked.” [Ecclesiastes 8:12, 13.]"},{"refcode_short":"8LtMs, Ms 111, 1893, par. 5","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 8 (1893), Ms 111, 1893, par. 5","content":"God is not like man, quick, decisive, condemnatory, visiting the guilty according to their deserts with immediate retribution.

It is natural for men to love those who love them, to worship those who worship them; but God is not a man that can be moved by bribed or flattery to countenance fraud and robbery, to pass by the indulgence of selfishness, and wink at dishonesty and injustice.

Injustice and oppression practiced by men in high position makes a deeper wound on the soul than does the same injustice from a source where less responsibility rests, where godliness is not professed.
