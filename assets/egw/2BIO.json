At the same time, the work of the church was getting a foothold in Europe, and J. N. Andrews was dispatched across the Atlantic to foster the developing work on another continent. These were indeed “progressive years,” and in these advancements James and Ellen White stood at the forefront—James, an apostle and organizer; and Ellen, a prophet, messenger of the Lord.

This made it possible for the handful of ministers who were preaching the word to be free to engage in aggressive evangelism.

But this was but one of the significant events of the year. As the year opened, the Civil War—the war between the States of the United States, sparked by the issues of slavery—had reached a point of vital concern to Seventh-day Adventists. Testimony No. 9, with its lead article, “The Rebellion,” came from the press in early January. In May the structure of church organization was completed in a one-day session at which the several State conferences were linked together into a General Conference. Moses Hull, one of the few ministers of the church, left its ranks to join the spiritualists. In the autumn James and Ellen White took their family to the East to get their children away from distracting war influences in Battle Creek, but before the year ended they had lost their eldest son in death. It was truly a momentous year. We will begin its story with the health reform vision."},{"refcode_short":"2BIO 11","refcode_long":"Ellen G.

Jackson, of Dansville, New York. How eagerly James and Ellen White read it. It made sense, and they immediately put its prescriptions into use, following every detail. The treatment called for was simple—employing only a washtub, towels, sheets, and blankets—but demanded diligent attention and earnest labor. In great detail Dr. Jackson pointed out the procedures that would bring relief and finally a cure.

The symptoms had overtaken their children very rapidly, and the Whites lost little time in carrying out—scrupulously—the directions of Dr. Jackson. They had appointments to speak in Convis, Michigan, on Sabbath and Sunday, February 7 and 8. By following Jackson's method of treating diphtheria, which involved the better part of Friday night, on Sabbath morning they saw that they could safely leave the sick children in the hands of those who helped in the home.

To avoid this, ways had to be found to encourage the enlistment of men to make up the required number.

Quite often articles and admonitions discouraging the use of tobacco, tea, and coffee were included. But as we have seen in connection with the scourge of diphtheria in the winter of 1862 and 1863, although the obituary notices kept before its readers the death of many children, up to February, 1863, the Review had little to offer to terrified parents but the application of a poultice of “Spanish flies and turpentine.” Then there came to the attention of James and Ellen White Dr. James C. Jackson's method of treatment of diphtheria, embodying simple, rational methods in the proper use of water, fresh air, and rest. Earnestly employed, these remedies saved two of the White boys when stricken, and also Moses Hull's boy, but upon the recovery of the children the experience was soon forgotten.

A plan emerged to issue five pamphlets (later increased to six) of sixty-four pages each, presenting some phase of what they saw before them along health lines that should be stressed. James White would do some writing, but the pamphlets would feature articles from physicians advocating reforms, and each would contain an article from Ellen White's pen under the general title “Disease and Its Causes.” In early September he noted that “the health question is much agitated among our people.”—The Review and Herald, September 6, 1864. Articles in the Review from Adventist writers J. N. Andrews, H. S. Gurney, and George Amadon, and selected materials from such physicians and other authors as Dr. Dio Lewis, L. B. Coles, and Horace Mann bore witness to this. The November 1, 1864, issue carried a pointed article from Martha Amadon entitled “How to Use Graham Flour.” Ellen White's comprehensive thirty-two-page chapter titled “Health,” in Spiritual Gifts,, Volume IV, published in August, 1864, was her first published material in the wide range of basic health matters."},{"refcode_short":"2BIO 90","refcode_long":"Ellen G.

The road seemed to ascend; on one side there was a deep precipice, and on the other, a high, smooth wall. As they journeyed, the road narrowed, causing them to leave their wagons and then their horses. As the perilous path narrowed, they took off their shoes. However, along the way they found ropes, representing faith, let down; these increased in size as they progressed. Finally they reached a chasm, beyond which was a beautiful field of green grass. To get there, they had to rely wholly upon the ropes; by these they could swing to the other side. In whispers the travelers inquired, “To what is the cord attached?” Hesitating and distressed, they heard the words “God holds the cords. We need not fear.” James first swung across the abyss and Ellen followed, and they were safely on the other side, praising God and perfectly happy (Testimonies for the Church, 2:594-597). “The dream needs no comment,” she stated as she told it.

The Review and Herald, with its weekly visits to the homes of those who subscribed, served an important pastoral role. This knowledge aids us in understanding the weakness and ease in backsliding of new and often inexperienced believers and officers that made up the churches, and the need of revival efforts put forth by James and Ellen White, J. N. Andrews, and a very few others. The successful camp meeting at Wright and the prospect of annual camp meetings in the several State conferences gave promise of building a stronger, cohesive, unified church. Wherever Ellen White ministered, it was seen that the Spirit of Prophecy messages calling for the turning from sin and development in experience and character brought stability and strength. The publishing of personal testimonies dealing with basic principles aided in this. Little wonder the great adversary pressed every means at his command to discourage and destroy, both from without and from within.

Then Ellen White introduced the case of Nathan Fuller, a minister in New York State who had become involved in a licentious course with some of the female members in his congregation. At a recent General Conference session Fuller had been a delegate from his conference (The Review and Herald, May 28, 1867). He was one of the four main speakers at the Wright camp meeting. But he had failed to keep himself clear of moral corruption. Ellen wrote:"},{"refcode_short":"2BIO 287.2","refcode_long":"Ellen G.

Through much of the year 1871 he studied ways to relate to the changes that must take place. He and Ellen sensed that plans must be devised that would result in a strong, continuing business administrative force heading the growing work of the church.

He recognized that White's powers were waning, but he was pleased when White engaged in the activities of the denomination, especially in launching and managing new enterprises. Butler demonstrated a continuing sense of the need of the light the Lord gave through Ellen White in teaching, guiding, and guarding the church. All this is reflected in the note attached to the call for the General Conference session to open in Battle Creek on March 11, which James and Ellen White in California would read, urging “in the strongest terms, their attendance at this session” (Ibid., February 11, 1873).

In spite of the disheartening experiences marked by discouragement, distrust, and accusation that occasionally took place, his talents, dedication, and experience were such that God continued to use him mightily at a time when the church was in great need of his contributions. In 1876, there was a repetition of the experience of 1874. James and Ellen White were residing in their Oakland, California, home, close to the Pacific Press. She was diligently writing on the life of Christ; James was president of the General Conference and at the same time was much involved in the developing interests of the newly established publishing house. He was called east to attend a special session of the General Conference and oversee the proposed enlargement of the Health Institute. He wanted her to accompany him and to remain in the East to attend the coming camp meetings.
