We felt no union with the church generally, and have spent our Sabbaths at home. But I will go back. When we came from the East last fall I told James that I had no liberty to bear my testimony in the church at Battle Creek; but he urged me to do so. I continued to do so, but to the discouragement of my own soul; and when I prayed in the meeting-house I had so little freedom I told my husband it should be the last time. I knew not the occasion of all this. I felt the same when relating or reading a vision in Uriah's and your presence. I was reluctant to do so, and had no freedom, and felt a strange dissatisfaction."},{"refcode_short":"PH016 5.2","refcode_long":"To Brother J. N. Andrews And Sister H. N.

Kellogg's the whole matter as shown me at Knoxville was opened before me. Things came vividly to mind which it had been impossible for me to recall. I was shown while at Knoxville the state of things at Battle Creek. I was shown the case of C. Smith's family, and was pointed back to the visions which they had not heeded. Then I saw Fletcher, Uriah, yourself and other individuals. It seemed to be a chain of connection, with dissatisfied feelings, and watching James and me with jealousy and suspicion. Uriah and James were shown me a distance apart from each other, not united. Darkness was in the Office. The angels of God were grieved, and had but little to do with the work there. There was a secret dissatisfaction, all carried on in darkness, concealed from us. Then I saw J. H. Waggoner, and the communications between him and Uriah. Uriah wronged James in writing to Bro. Waggoner, and Bro. Waggoner wronged him by not being open and frank. If Bro. Waggoner had said to Uriah, If Bro. White is wrong in his feelings in regard to you, I am more so; I have burdened his mind with my feelings in regard to these things; do not judge harshly of Bro. White in this matter, for I was equally to blame, then matters would have been left in a different shape. But that matter was not left right. It was left half finished, with all the censure upon James, like many other things. God frowns upon such injustice. There was occasion for Bro. White's feelings and Bro. Waggoner's; but their feelings were too strong, and their course was wrong in not going directly to Uriah and talking over matters with him. But Uriah's and your wrong was still greater in carrying the matter to others, and writing to Waukon before speaking to James upon the matter."},{"refcode_short":"PH016 6.1","refcode_long":"To Brother J.

It is still looked upon that Bro. White dealt too plain, and you are not free in this matter. From what has been shown me he dealt no plainer than the case deserved. And the dissatisfaction and warfare against the testimony and visions there borne must be seen, felt and acknowledged, or they will be subject to wrong influences and the temptations of the Devil. They will appear to be united with us, but when in God's order plain dealing or reproofs are given, all the past is called up and the same warfare commences, and they are more liable to sympathize with those who are wrong than with the right. All these things will have to be realized and thorough work made. The influence and feelings which existed in Paris has affected your judgment, and still sways your mind. You have received and cherished feelings that Bro. White was too hard and severe, and if one is censured or has plain matters of fact laid before them, they complain of Bro. White's severity, and you stand all ready to sympathize with them. In this you come short of being a co-worker with God and his angels. God lays a burden on his servant that things are not right; he must bear a plain testimony. It is not pleasant for him to do this. He would gladly be excused, but must do his duty regardless of consequences. Who then I ask, deserves the sympathy? The one who feels the burden, and in the fear of God discharges his duty, or the erring one who causes trouble and burden by grieving the Spirit of God? Just as long as God has a people, just as long as he has a church, he will have those who will cry aloud and spare not, who will be his instruments to reprove selfishness and sins, and will not shun to declare the whole counsel of God, whether men will hear or forbear. I saw that individuals would rise up against the plain testimonies. It does not suit their natural feelings. They would choose to have smooth things spoken unto them, and have peace cried in their ears. You would choose to be flattered and caressed. But this is not the work that God has assigned us. Individuals have been watching James with jealousy and suspicion, and the feelings and the prejudices have been communicated to each other, while he was left in darkness as to the real state of their feelings, and they were doubting the messages which the Lord had given. I saw that a great trial was before the church at Battle Creek. I saw that James must be careful whom he trusted or confided in, for he was watched by some of his brethren at Battle Creek, and watched by those in the Office, especially by yourself, Uriah and Fletcher. I saw that the leaven of dissatisfaction that worked in Paris and Rochester has been at work here. The messages which the Lord gave in Paris were doubted. The plain reproofs that my husband there bore were not received, but he was looked upon as being hard and severe; but I was shown that had he borne a more mild testimony he would have merited the displeasure of God. The feelings of those in Paris were not in union with the spirit and work of God, and they realized not the sacrifices and self-denial that must be made by them as well as others to fill their place in the work of God. When they were reproved, instead of searching carefully their own hearts and confessing their wrongs, self rose up, It can't be so! They dwelt upon what they regarded as Bro. White's severity, sympathized with each other, linked together in their unbelief and dissatisfaction. And they never yet have seen and realized their wrong course, or our sufferings in Paris, which need not have been as severe if they had taken a right course. All this is recorded, and will yet appear before them in its true light, just as Heaven regards it. They were willing to think they had been dealt too severely with. Satan helped them in the matter. Angels were grieved and turned from them, and they went into great darkness. They rejected the means which God had chosen to correct them, and their discernment between a right and wrong spirit was gone. Bro. J. N. A. sympathized with his friends in Paris. Their feelings and their course of action affected him, influenced his mind, and his judgment and his sympathies were perverted, and he often stood on the side of those who were cautioned or reproved, which caused trouble instead of healing the difficulty. This all arose from not having his sympathy and influence with those whom he should have confidence in, and leaving those to bear and fully feel their burden who were not right, that by diligent search of their own course they might make strait and thorough work. Things at Paris were left at loose ends, all prepared for Satan to tangle into a perplexing knot to suit himself. They never have realized their wrongs and taken them out of the way. The bars were left down for Satan to step in and possess the field. When everything moves on smoothly then past dissatisfaction and difficulties originating in Paris lie dormant; but when reproof is given the same warfare commences. Bro. White is wrong, he is severe, he was hard back there, he is the same now. Jealousy and hard feelings arise, and as he is in union with the visions, as the visions and his testimony agree, the visions are doubted. And Satan has worked secretly, first at Waukon, and then at Battle Creek, to affect and overthrow the work of God."},{"refcode_short":"PH016 10.1","refcode_long":"To Brother J. N. Andrews And Sister H. N. Smith, p. 10.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I was pointed back, away back to the time when those in Paris, especially Brn. Andrewsâ€™ and Steven's families were ensnared by error, and for years were in a perfect deception of Satan. They suffered while in this error, but they never will obtain a particle of reward for it. If they had been willing to be taught, and received light in God's appointed way, they would not have been held in error, fanaticism and darkness all that length of time; but self would not yield to the light God gave. Their feelings and impressions were sufficient evidence for them, and they would not be corrected until they were overwhelmed and compelled to acknowledge the power of God, and that they were wrong. God has given them since that time unmistakable evidence of his work, and wonderful manifestations of his Spirit. Repeatedly have some of them been slain by the power of God, and while the impression remains all is well; but when the impression wears away the same wrong feelings return, self rises, because they did not make thorough work behind them. I saw that it was of the greatest importance that they make thorough work in the past. I was brought down to Rochester, and saw the same suspicion and jealousy existed there, and your influence was not good, and I saw that things in Rochester and vicinity were in such a condition that God would have us leave Rochester just when we did, and I saw that there had been a lack of frank acknowledgement from Bro. J. N. A. yourself, Uriah and others, that it was the special work of God our leaving Rochester at the time we did, notwithstanding the most positive evidence has been given of this, to seal that whole work of God: the prosperity God has given the Office and the cause since the removal to Battle Creek. Yet there has not been straight work in acknowledging this as God's special providence. While God was directing and counselling in regard to these matters, that his work could move forward with freedom, their feelings were in opposition to it. Had they been standing in the counsel of God they would have been in union with his work and with the angels, but individuals were ignorantly warring against the leadings of God, and had no realizing sense of their fearful position of being united with evil angels in their opposition to the advancement of God's work and his opening providence. Had they believed what the Lord had shown in regard to these matters, they need not have moved in such perfect blindness. All that work of God must be acknowledged, and with decision a position taken in these things, or Satan will improve every opportunity to throw in doubts, suggestions and jealousy, and the leaven will continue to work. This leaven must be purged out. When God's hand is reached down, and he moves his people to the right or left it is of the greatest importance that they acknowledge his hand and firmly take their position that God has done this. The state of things in Rochester should be a warning to all who are tempted to doubt the teachings of God, or to find fault with the strait testimony and reproofs given by Bro. White. The angels of God do not hover in mercy over Rochester. A curse has rested there, and all the deeds and cruel work of those in Rochester and vicinity are recorded. Satan has kept the mind in perfect darkness in regard to these things. God is not to be trifled with. Sufferings and agony his servants bore in Rochester while striving with all their energies to do his work. Satan and evil angels were at war with them, and many professing the present truth united with these evil powers to discourage and cause mental anguish, which might have been avoided. They were co-workers with the powers of darkness. All this is faithfully chronicled. Yet notwithstanding the example of Rochester, and their present condition, which should be a warning, the same work has been going on at Battle Creek in a secret, underhanded, deceptive manner. The same spirit which existed in Paris and Rochester has revived, and there is no safety or confidence to hope for better things until the past is all straitened out by frankly acknowledging God's work, if it tears self and self dignity all to pieces."},{"refcode_short":"PH016 12.1","refcode_long":"To Brother J.

Says the true Witness, I know thy works. It has been to disaffect the minds of others in regard to James, to place him in a wrong light before them, and put on a distressed appearance, which has had its influence with a number of individuals, yet you faithfully concealed all this from us. But I have been shown that the counsel and strait testimony will not cease as long as God has anything to do with this church and with the Office. The plain testimony will cut to the right and left, and the church will have to be hewed and squared. The planning-knife of God will pass over them, and if individuals will not bear the strait work they will be laid aside as useless timber, unfit to have any place in the cause or work of God. Harriet, I was shown the past position John occupied after he went to Waukon. The spirit of rebellion that arose there is not dead yet.

Their own selfish feelings and views stand directly in their way. They must either yield their feelings, if it [tears] them all to pieces, or the visions must be given up. There will be full union or disunion. The crisis has come. The warfare that has been waged against James and the testimonies given of God must be given up if every one in that Office is removed. O Harriet, your past course for months was unfolded to me. Your opposition of feeling to James; your manifesting so much agony of feelings if there is counsel or the slightest reproof given in the Office, and your professing so much fear of James as though he were a tyrant. You have been deceived, and acted under a perfect deception of the Devil, and have deceived others in regard to James. The least advice or counsel has been construed into a reproof, and you have stood prepared to have your feelings reined up to the highest pitch, and then your unreconciled, strong, set, willful feelings have been carried out into manifestations of great agony, which have had the worst possible influence upon Uriah, and has had a complete tendency to tear him from James and cause him to consider himself and you abused when it was a deception of Satan. You who ought to have been a help to Uriah and sought to have relieved his mind if burdened or in trial, have taken a course to stir up his mind, throwing him into perplexity and bringing upon him the greatest trials he has ever suffered, and all this without a cause.

Your influence instead of strengthening and helping Uriah has hindered him, and planted in his breast feelings which would never have existed there if you had been consecrated to God. Your influence, appearance and actions have had just that strong influence on the wrong side that the Lord showed me two years ago that they would have, unless you stood in the counsel of God, consecrated to his service, with your judgment sanctified by his Spirit.

But Satan leads them on blindfolded in regard to the true state of their feelings, until he takes them in his snare. Grievous sins have been rebuked in individuals whom the church was holding in close fellowship, believing them to be devoted, sincere Christians. The persons reproved have risen up against the visions, contradicted their truthfulness, and have received the sympathy of some of the church. But time has proved the visions correct; facts have been brought to confirm and establish them. At times I have had but little courage to write to individuals what I had been shown in regard to them, for so many take the visions which have been written to them with feelings of the deepest anguish and in tears, they lay it aside, some with a feeling of indifference, others say I believe the visions, but sister White has made a mistake in writing it.

The heart is deceitful above all things; and desperately wicked. Satan exults that he can lead individuals to deceive themselves into a belief that they are right, when God frowns upon their wrongs. God seeth not as man seeth, and when he shows what is in erring man's heart, and the message is trampled under foot, and he turns from it, saying, There must be a mistake in the matter, I am about right, they are like the pharisee who repeated his good works, I fast twice a week and give tithes of all I possess.

This attachment was not because each family was so holy, and reflected the image of Jesus so much, that bound one to the other.

The burdens were not equally borne. While he took much responsibility, some were not willing to take any, and those who shunned taking responsibilities and burdens did not realize his burdens, and were not as interested in the cause as they should have been. There was a lack. James felt it and laid his shoulder under burdens that were too heavy. I saw by these extra efforts more souls would be saved, but it is these efforts that have undermined his constitution and taken away his strength. Regardless of his own interest and health, he has labored with interest for others, and it has not been appreciated. His reward from many has been dissatisfaction, evil surmising and jealousy. Those who should have helped him bear the burdens were a burden themselves by their unwise course. By care and incessant labor and overwhelming anxiety has the work gone on, until now the present truth is clear, its evidence by the candid undoubted, and it is easy work now to carry on the paper to what it was a few years ago.
