But all too frequently the laws established by God to govern the life are flagrantly transgressed; sin enters the heart, and man loses sight of his dependence upon God, the source of life and health.

He “took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses,” that He might minister to every need of humanity. Matthew 8:17. The burden of disease and wretchedness and sin He came to remove.

His compassion knew no limit. On so large a scale did He conduct His work of healing and teaching that there was no building in Palestine large enough to receive the multitudes that thronged to Him. On the green hill slopes of Galilee, in the thoroughfares of travel, by the seashore, in the synagogues, and in every other place where the sick could be brought to Him, was to be found His hospital. In every city, every town, every village, through which He passed, He laid His hands upon the afflicted ones and healed them. Wherever there were hearts ready to receive His message, He comforted them with the assurance of their heavenly Father's love. All day He ministered to those who came to Him; in the evening He gave attention to such as through the day must toil to earn a pittance for the support of their families."},{"refcode_short":"MH 18.1","refcode_long":"The Ministry of Healing, p. 18.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Jesus carried the awful weight of responsibility for the salvation of men. He knew that unless there was a decided change in the principles and purposes of the human race, all would be lost. This was the burden of His soul, and none could appreciate the weight that rested upon Him. Through childhood, youth, and manhood He walked alone. Yet it was heaven to be in His presence. Day by day He met trials and temptations; day by day He was brought into contact with evil and witnessed its power upon those whom He was seeking to bless and to save. Yet He did not fail or become discouraged."},{"refcode_short":"MH 19.1","refcode_long":"The Ministry of Healing, p. 19.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In all things He brought His wishes into strict abeyance to His mission. He glorified His life by making everything in it subordinate to the will of His Father. When in His youth His mother, finding Him in the school of the rabbis, said, “Son, why hast Thou thus dealt with us?” He answered,—and His answer is the keynote of His lifework,—“How is it that ye sought Me? wist ye not that I must be about My Father's business?” Luke 2:48, 49."},{"refcode_short":"MH 19.2","refcode_long":"The Ministry of Healing, p. 19.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"His life was one of constant self-sacrifice. He had no home in this world except as the kindness of friends provided for Him as a wayfarer.

His miracles testified to the truth of His words, that He came not to destroy, but to save. Wherever He went, the tidings of His mercy preceded Him. Where He had passed, the objects of His compassion were rejoicing in health and making trial of their new-found powers. Crowds were collecting around them to hear from their lips the works that the Lord had wrought. His voice was the first sound that many had ever heard, His name the first word they had ever spoken, His face the first they had ever looked upon. Why should they not love Jesus and sound His praise? As He passed through the towns and cities He was like a vital current, diffusing life and joy."},{"refcode_short":"MH 20.1","refcode_long":"The Ministry of Healing, p. 20.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"“The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,\nToward the sea, beyond the Jordan,\nGalilee of the nations,\nThe people that sat in darkness\nSaw a great light,\nAnd to them that sat in the region and shadow of death,\nTo them did light spring up.” Matthew 4:15, 16, A.R.V., margin."},{"refcode_short":"MH 20.2","refcode_long":"The Ministry of Healing, p. 20.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The Saviour made each work of healing an occasion for implanting divine principles in the mind and soul.

He went from place to place, that those in the highways and byways might hear the words of truth. By the sea, on the mountainside, in the streets of the city, in the synagogue, His voice was heard explaining the Scriptures. Often He taught in the outer court of the temple, that the Gentiles might hear His words."},{"refcode_short":"MH 21.1","refcode_long":"The Ministry of Healing, p. 21.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"So unlike the explanations of Scripture given by the scribes and Pharisees was Christ's teaching, that the attention of the people was arrested. The rabbis dwelt upon tradition, upon human theory and speculation. Often that which men had taught and written about the Scripture was put in place of the Scripture itself. The subject of Christ's teaching was the word of God. He met questioners with a plain, “It is written,” “What saith the Scripture?” “How readest thou?” At every opportunity when an interest was awakened by either friend or foe, He presented the word. With clearness and power He proclaimed the gospel message. His words shed a flood of light on the teachings of patriarchs and prophets, and the Scriptures came to men as a new revelation. Never before had His hearers perceived in the word of God such depth of meaning."},{"refcode_short":"MH 22.1","refcode_long":"The Ministry of Healing, p. 22.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Never was there such an evangelist as Christ. He was the Majesty of heaven, but He humbled Himself to take our nature, that He might meet men where they were. To all people, rich and poor, free and bond, Christ, the Messenger of the covenant, brought the tidings of salvation. His fame as the Great Healer spread throughout Palestine. The sick came to the places through which He would pass, that they might call on Him for help. Hither, too, came many anxious to hear His words and to receive a touch of His hand. Thus He went from city to city, from town to town, preaching the gospel and healing the sick—the King of glory in the lowly garb of humanity."},{"refcode_short":"MH 22.2","refcode_long":"The Ministry of Healing, p. 22.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"He attended the great yearly festivals of the nation, and to the multitude absorbed in outward ceremony He spoke of heavenly things, bringing eternity within their view. To all He brought treasures from the storehouse of wisdom. He spoke to them in language so simple that they could not fail of understanding. By methods peculiarly His own, He helped all who were in sorrow and affliction. With tender, courteous grace He ministered to the sin-sick soul, bringing healing and strength."},{"refcode_short":"MH 23.1","refcode_long":"The Ministry of Healing, p. 23.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The prince of teachers, He sought access to the people by the pathway of their most familiar associations. He presented the truth in such a way that ever after it was to His hearers intertwined with their most hallowed recollections and sympathies. He taught in a way that made them feel the completeness of His identification with their interests and happiness. His instruction was so direct, His illustrations were so appropriate, His words so sympathetic and cheerful, that His hearers were charmed. The simplicity and earnestness with which He addressed the needy, hallowed every word."},{"refcode_short":"MH 24.1","refcode_long":"The Ministry of Healing, p. 24.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"What a busy life He led! Day by day He might have been seen entering the humble abodes of want and sorrow, speaking hope to the downcast and peace to the distressed. Gracious, tenderhearted, pitiful, He went about lifting up the bowed-down and comforting the sorrowful. Wherever He went, He carried blessing."},{"refcode_short":"MH 24.2","refcode_long":"The Ministry of Healing, p. 24.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"While He ministered to the poor, Jesus studied also to find ways of reaching the rich. He sought the acquaintance of the wealthy and cultured Pharisee, the Jewish nobleman, and the Roman ruler. He accepted their invitations, attended their feasts, made Himself familiar with their interests and occupations, that He might gain access to their hearts, and reveal to them the imperishable riches."},{"refcode_short":"MH 25.1","refcode_long":"The Ministry of Healing, p. 25.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Christ came to this world to show that by receiving power from on high, man can live an unsullied life.

By the gentle touch of grace He banished from the soul unrest and doubt, changing enmity to love, and unbelief to confidence."},{"refcode_short":"MH 25.2","refcode_long":"The Ministry of Healing, p. 25.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"He could say to whom He pleased, “Follow Me,” and the one addressed arose and followed Him.

The scribes and Pharisees desired to make a local and a national benefit of the gifts of heaven and to exclude the rest of God's family in the world.

No question of policy influenced His movements. He made no difference between neighbors and strangers, friends and enemies. That which appealed to His heart was a soul thirsting for the waters of life."},{"refcode_short":"MH 25.5","refcode_long":"The Ministry of Healing, p. 25.5 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"He passed by no human being as worthless, but sought to apply the healing remedy to every soul. In whatever company He found Himself He presented a lesson appropriate to the time and the circumstances. Every neglect or insult shown by men to their fellow men only made Him more conscious of their need of His divine-human sympathy. He sought to inspire with hope the roughest and most unpromising, setting before them the assurance that they might become blameless and harmless, attaining such a character as would make them manifest as the children of God."},{"refcode_short":"MH 26.1","refcode_long":"The Ministry of Healing, p. 26.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Often He met those who had drifted under Satan's control, and who had no power to break from his snare. To such a one, discouraged, sick, tempted, fallen, Jesus would speak words of tenderest pity, words that were needed and could be understood. Others He met who were fighting a hand-to-hand battle with the adversary of souls. These He encouraged to persevere, assuring them that they would win; for angels of God were on their side and would give them the victory."},{"refcode_short":"MH 26.2","refcode_long":"The Ministry of Healing, p. 26.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"At the table of the publicans He sat as an honored guest, by His sympathy and social kindliness showing that He recognized the dignity of humanity; and men longed to become worthy of His confidence.

New impulses were awakened, and to these outcasts of society there opened the possibility of a new life."},{"refcode_short":"MH 26.3","refcode_long":"The Ministry of Healing, p. 26.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Though He was a Jew, Jesus mingled freely with the Samaritans, setting at nought the Pharisaic customs of His nation. In face of their prejudices He accepted the hospitality of this despised people. He slept with them under their roofs, ate with them at their tables,—partaking of the food prepared and served by their hands,—taught in their streets, and treated them with the utmost kindness and courtesy. And while He drew their hearts to Him by the tie of human sympathy, His divine grace brought to them the salvation which the Jews rejected."},{"refcode_short":"MH 27","refcode_long":"The Ministry of Healing, p. 27 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Personal Ministry"},{"refcode_short":"MH 27.1","refcode_long":"The Ministry of Healing, p. 27.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Christ neglected no opportunity of proclaiming the gospel of salvation. Listen to His wonderful words to that one woman of Samaria. He was sitting by Jacob's well, as the woman came to draw water. To her surprise He asked a favor of her. “Give Me to drink,” He said. He wanted a cool draft, and He wished also to open the way whereby He might give to her the water of life. “How is it,” said the woman, “that Thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.” Jesus answered, “If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give Me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of Him, and He would have given thee living water.... Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.” John 4:7-14."},{"refcode_short":"MH 28.1","refcode_long":"The Ministry of Healing, p. 28.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"How much interest Christ manifested in this one woman! How earnest and eloquent were His words! When the woman heard them, she left her waterpot, and went into the city, saying to her friends, “Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?” We read that “many of the Samaritans of that city believed on Him.” Verses 29, 39.

The miracle had been wrought upon the Sabbath, and for fear of the rabbis the people dared not come for healing until the sun was set. Then from the homes, the shops, the market places, the inhabitants of the city pressed toward the humble dwelling that sheltered Jesus.

Jesus was not satisfied to attract attention to Himself merely as a wonder-worker or as a healer of physical disease. He was seeking to draw men to Him as their Saviour. While the people were eager to believe that He had come as a king to establish an earthly reign, He desired to turn their minds from the earthly to the spiritual. Mere worldly success would interfere with His work."},{"refcode_short":"MH 31.2","refcode_long":"The Ministry of Healing, p. 31.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"And the wonder of the careless crowd jarred upon His spirits. No self-assertion mingled with His life. The homage which the world gives to position, wealth, or talent was foreign to the Son of man. None of the means that men employ to win allegiance or command homage did Jesus use. Centuries before His birth it had been prophesied of Him, “He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause His voice to be heard in the street.

His voice reached the ears of the dying, and they arose in health and vigor. Paralyzed demoniacs obeyed His word, their madness left them, and they worshiped Him.

They add house to house, and land to land; they fill their homes with luxuries, while all about them are human beings in misery and crime, in disease and death.

There are many who regard the expression of love as a weakness, and they maintain a reserve that repels others. This spirit checks the current of sympathy.

The object lesson given at the birth of the nation was of a nature deeply to impress all hearts. Before the last terrible judgment came upon the Egyptians in the death of the first-born, God commanded His people to gather their children into their own homes.

Give yourselves the culture of spiritual thoughts and holy communings. You have seen but the first rays of the early dawn of His glory. As you follow on to know the Lord, you will know that “the path of the righteous is as the light of dawn, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.” Proverbs 4:18, R.V., margin."},{"refcode_short":"MH 504.1","refcode_long":"The Ministry of Healing, p. 504.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"“These things have I spoken unto you,” said Christ, “that My joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.” John 15:11."},{"refcode_short":"MH 504.2","refcode_long":"The Ministry of Healing, p. 504.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Ever before Him, Christ saw the result of His mission.

He heard the ransomed ones singing the song of Moses and the Lamb.

All nature, in its surpassing loveliness, will offer to God a tribute of praise and adoration. The world will be bathed in the light of heaven. The light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold greater than it is now. The years will move on in gladness.
