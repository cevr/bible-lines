Loud words are not needed. Sweet, kind words are like dew and gentle showers to the soul. Take all the ugly features out of the voice. The very best school for voice culture is in the home life.

He does not call for the erection of immense institutions. One corner of the vineyard is not the whole world. In many places throughout the world memorials for God are to be established to represent His truth.
