When she urged, “build a college after the Lord's pattern,” Australasian Missionary College arose.

For example, she counseled a workaholic preacher in his sunset years to be temperate in his labors, for he was killing himself by overwork.

During his apostasy, there were in the kingdom men who remained true to their trust, maintaining their purity and loyalty. But many were led astray; and the forces of evil set in operation by the introduction of idolatry and worldly practices, could not easily be stayed by the penitent king. His influence for good was greatly weakened. Many hesitated to place full confidence in his leadership. Though the king confessed his sin, and wrote out, for the benefit of after-generations, a record of his folly and repentance, he could never hope entirely to destroy the baleful influence of his wrong deeds. Emboldened by his apostasy, many continued to do evil, and evil only.

I have known her nearly 40 years, and Mrs. Starr has known her over 50 years. We have learned from her own lips the story of her early conversion at the age of 13 years, from doubt and darkness into light and special love for the person of Jesus Christ. I think I have never heard any other person speak of love for Jesus, personal love, as I have heard her speak. Many times, in large congregations, I have heard her break forth in the expression, “Jesus, I love you; I love you, I love you!” Some here know that; they have heard it; and it has thrilled the audience. We have felt the influence of that love for Jesus."},{"refcode_short":"RY 216.2","refcode_long":"The Retirement Years, p. 216.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I believe it is a splendid thing for us to emulate, not only to have faith in a general way, but faith in Jesus and in His love.

The language in her writings is of the most attractive, simple, and forceful style. Now, I will leave you to judge that for yourselves, that it is attractive, elevating, forceful, and there is nothing to be found like it in the world. I have never seen anyone whose writings at all imitated her writings. In the little book Steps to Christ—I had the privilege of reading that book in the manuscript, and she asked several of us to advise what should be done with it. “Why,” we said, “put it into every language as soon as possible, for it is the simplest, clearest guide in the saving faith of Jesus we have ever read.” That book has been translated into [many] languages."},{"refcode_short":"RY 217.1","refcode_long":"The Retirement Years, p. 217.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I saw a table with a complete set of her published books on it.

I have studied the writings of a good many, but I know of no one who is as diligent as she was, getting up at 2, 3, or 4 o'clock in the morning, and working until after sundown. She retired very early, that was her habit, and then early in the morning she would arise and begin her writing. You would find her, like all the prophets, rising early and doing her work."},{"refcode_short":"RY 217.3","refcode_long":"The Retirement Years, p. 217.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I have seen her, I think, under nearly all the circumstances under which you meet a friend. We had the privilege of traveling with her in Michigan, and then of accompanying her to Australia, living in her home, seeing her under all the circumstances of home life, and, in addition, with the burdens of the world's work that she loved upon her; and I want to testify today that Mrs. Starr and I consider her one of the most constant, faithful Christians that we have met in our lives. I do not say that in order to praise her here today, but I believe it from the heart; I have reason to know it, I know it personally."},{"refcode_short":"RY 218.1","refcode_long":"The Retirement Years, p. 218.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"She has been a great help to me personally.

Her remembrance of names of individuals was very remarkable. She never seemed to forget a person whom she met in any part of the world. She carried them on her heart and in her prayers. Her faithfulness in friendship was very marked, extending through trial and temptation. As the little boy at school said when asked the meaning of friendship, “A true friend is one who knows all about you and loves you just the same,” so we can say of her, that though she knew the failings of her friends very well, she loved them just the same, and prayed for them and labored for them just the same."},{"refcode_short":"RY 218.3","refcode_long":"The Retirement Years, p. 218.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Another word about her character: I regarded her as one of the sturdiest characters I ever met. I can compare her life only to the sturdy oak that meets the wind and bears its severest pressure; or the mountain that laughs at the storm. She met trial and opposition from those who ought to have been friendly; and she met it in the kindest, sweetest spirit, but with the firmest determination to conquer, always conquer. I never knew her to be conquered. Her faith in God was invincible in this country, or any other country. Under circumstances that would have swamped the faith of many, she triumphed under trial."},{"refcode_short":"RY 219.1","refcode_long":"The Retirement Years, p. 219.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Just a word further about her sickness. It has been her lot, as Brother Loughborough remarked, to suffer more than the ordinary Christian. God permitted it, and she—I think I will let her speak for herself as to how she regarded it. I have a statement here from her own writings that I will read:"},{"refcode_short":"RY 219.2","refcode_long":"The Retirement Years, p. 219.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"“I do not now expect to be lifted above all infirmities and tribulations, and to have an unruffled sea on the journey heavenward. I expect trials, losses, disappointments, and bereavements”—and she had them, two children and her husband buried where she will soon be buried by their side, in Michigan; she had her trials in that way, and in other ways—“but I have the Saviour's promise, ‘My grace is sufficient for thee.’"},{"refcode_short":"RY 219.3","refcode_long":"The Retirement Years, p. 219.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"“My sickness has taught me my own weakness, and my Saviour's patience and love, and His power to save. When passing sleepless nights, I have found hope and comfort in considering the forbearance and tenderness of Jesus toward His weak, erring disciples, and remembering that He is still the same—unchangeable in mercy, compassion, and love. He sees our weakness; He knows how we lack faith and courage; yet He does not cast us off. He is pitiful and of tender compassion toward us.”"},{"refcode_short":"RY 219.4","refcode_long":"The Retirement Years, p. 219.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"About six weeks ago we called on her, and she said, “When were you in last to see me?”"},{"refcode_short":"RY 220.1","refcode_long":"The Retirement Years, p. 220.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"“Just last Sabbath afternoon,” I replied."},{"refcode_short":"RY 220.2","refcode_long":"The Retirement Years, p. 220.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"“Oh, yes,” she said, “I forgot.” And then she turned to us and said: “We all have our weaknesses and our forgetfulnesses, but if we correct them they add strength to our characters and do not belittle us.” Now that, you see, is similar to her statement that Christ reveals his tender compassion through suffering."},{"refcode_short":"RY 220.3","refcode_long":"The Retirement Years, p. 220.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Speaking of her death, she said: “I may fall at my post before the Lord shall come; but when all that are in their graves shall come forth, I shall, if faithful to”—and she was faithful—“see Jesus, and be made like Him. Oh, what joy, unspeakable, to see Him whom we love—to see Him in His glory who so loved us that he gave Himself for us—to behold those hands once pierced for our redemption, stretched out to us in blessing and welcome!” Those are triumphant words, aren't they?"},{"refcode_short":"RY 220.4","refcode_long":"The Retirement Years, p. 220.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Now, while here, she sang considerably. I want to read you one verse of one song that she very much delighted in. We heard her singing it the other morning, as we were at the bottom of the stairs. We said, “Who is that singing?” And they said, “That is Sister White.” Here is what she sang: “We have heard from the bright, the holy land, we have heard, and our hearts are glad; for we were a lonely pilgrim band, and weary, and worn, and sad.

I said, “We are glad to find you so bright this morning.” This was her reply: “I am glad you find me thus, and I wish to tell you that it is bright inside.” And then she added, “I have not had many mournful days, have I?” “No, Sister White,” I said, “not in all your life, because you have risen above them.” “Yes,” said she, “my heavenly father has planned it all for me, and he knows when it will end, and I am determined not to murmur.”"},{"refcode_short":"RY 221.3","refcode_long":"The Retirement Years, p. 221.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I felt that that was a great triumph—and she did triumph.
