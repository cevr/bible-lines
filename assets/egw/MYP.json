She knew the struggles of childhood and youth with the powers of darkness, and she knew the life of victory in Christ. Many messages of instruction, sympathy, reproof, and encouragement have come from her pen, addressed directly to the young people.

The General Conference Missionary Volunteer Department has, therefore, gone over all that she has written in our periodicals from the beginning of her work, and has made selections of matter pertaining to young people and young people's problems. While it has not always been possible to preserve the entire article, care has been exercised to make such selections as would give clearly the author's ideas on the subject treated.

He bore all the insult and mockery that wicked men could heap upon Him. And when His earthly ministry was accomplished, He suffered the death of the cross. Consider His sufferings on the cross,—the nails driven into His hands and feet, the derision and abuse from those He came to save, the hiding of His Father's face.

When believers are neglectful of their dress, and are coarse and rough in their manners, their influence hurts the truth. “We are,” said the inspired apostle, “made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.” All heaven is marking the daily influence that the professed followers of Christ exert upon the world...."},{"refcode_short":"MYP 353.2","refcode_long":"Messages to Young People, p. 353.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Simplicity of dress will make a sensible woman appear to the best advantage.

The great adversary finds ready access to those whom he has controlled in the past, and through them he accomplishes his purpose. Various entertainments are introduced to make the meetings interesting and attractive for worldlings, and thus the exercises of the so-called literary society too often degenerate into demoralizing theatrical performances and cheap nonsense.

They should seek to glorify God by their union from the first, and during every year of their married life. They should calmly consider what provision can be made for their children. They have no right to bring children into the world to be a burden to others. Have they a business that they can rely upon to sustain a family, so that they need not become a burden to others? If they have not, they commit a crime in bringing children into the world to suffer for want of proper care, food, and clothing."},{"refcode_short":"MYP 462","refcode_long":"Messages to Young People, p. 462 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The Domination of Passion"},{"refcode_short":"MYP 462.3","refcode_long":"Messages to Young People, p. 462.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In this fast, corrupt age these things are not considered. Lustful passion bears away, and will not submit to control, although feebleness, misery, and death are the result of its reign. Women are forced to a life of hardship, pain, and suffering, because of the uncontrollable passions of men who bear the name of husband—more rightly could they be called brutes. Mothers drag out a miserable existence, with children in their arms nearly all the time, managing every way to put bread into their mouths and clothes upon their backs. Such accumulated misery fills the world."},{"refcode_short":"MYP 463.1","refcode_long":"Messages to Young People, p. 463.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"There is but little real, genuine, devoted pure love. This precious article is very rare. Passion is termed love. Many a woman has had her fine and tender sensibilities outraged, because the marriage relation allowed him whom she called husband to be brutal in his treatment of her.

The result is that a sense of languor and depression is frequently felt, but the cause is seldom divined as being the result of their own improper course of action. We are under solemn obligations to God to keep the spirit pure and the body healthy, that we may be a benefit to humanity, and render to God perfect service—Testimonies for the Church 2:380, 381."},{"refcode_short":"MYP 464","refcode_long":"Messages to Young People, p. 464 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Chapter 157—The Example of Isaac"},{"refcode_short":"MYP 464.1","refcode_long":"Messages to Young People, p. 464.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"No one who fears God can without danger connect himself with one who fears Him not. “Can two walk together, except they be agreed?” The happiness and prosperity of the marriage relation depends upon the unity of the parties; but between the believer and the unbeliever there is a radical difference of tastes, inclinations, and purposes. They are serving two masters, between whom there can be no concord. However pure and correct one's principles may be, the influence of an unbelieving companion will have a tendency to lead away from God."},{"refcode_short":"MYP 464.2","refcode_long":"Messages to Young People, p. 464.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"He who has entered the marriage relation while unconverted is by his conversion placed under stronger obligation to be faithful to his companion, however widely they may differ in regard to religious faith; yet the claims of God should be placed above every earthly relationship, even though trials and persecution may be the result. With the spirit of love and meekness, this fidelity may have an influence to win the unbelieving one. But the marriage of Christians with the ungodly is forbidden in the Bible.

And the result of that marriage, as presented in the Scriptures, is a tender and beautiful picture of domestic happiness: “Isaac brought her unto his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.”"},{"refcode_short":"MYP 465.1","refcode_long":"Messages to Young People, p. 465.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"What a contrast between the course of Isaac and that pursued by the youth of our time, even among professed Christians! Young people too often feel that the bestowal of their affections is a matter in which self alone should be consulted—a matter that neither God nor their parents should in any wise control. Long before they have reached manhood or womanhood, they think themselves competent to make their own choice, without the aid of their parents. A few years of married life are usually sufficient to show them their error, but often too late to prevent its baleful results. For the same lack of wisdom and self-control that dictated the hasty choice is permitted to aggravate the evil, until the marriage relation becomes a galling yoke. Many have thus wrecked their happiness in this life, and their hope of the life to come."},{"refcode_short":"MYP 465.2","refcode_long":"Messages to Young People, p. 465.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"If there is any subject which should be carefully considered, and in which the counsel of older and more experienced persons should be sought, it is the subject of marriage; if ever the Bible was needed as a counselor, if ever divine guidance should be sought in prayer, it is before taking a step that binds persons together for life."},{"refcode_short":"MYP 465.3","refcode_long":"Messages to Young People, p. 465.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Parents should never lose sight of their own responsibility for the future happiness of their children. Isaac's deference of his father's judgment was the result of the training that had taught him to love a life of obedience. While Abraham required his children to respect parental authority, his daily life testified that that authority was not a selfish or arbitrary control, but was founded in love, and had their welfare and happiness in view."},{"refcode_short":"MYP 466.1","refcode_long":"Messages to Young People, p. 466.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Fathers and mothers should feel that a duty devolves upon them to guide the affections of the youth, that they may be placed upon those who will be suitable companions. They should feel it a duty, by their own teaching and example, with the assisting grace of God, to so mold the character of the children from their earliest years that they will be pure and noble, and will be attracted to the good and true. Like attracts like; like appreciates like.
