The school building was now closely surrounded by the town, and the “boarding house” three blocks up the street was being choked by nearby residential housing. When built, the boarding house, on a five-acre tract of land, was in the country, and it had been planned that as funds were available, more land surrounding it would be purchased. But money was scarce, so part of the original acreage was sold. Houses soon sprang up. M. E.

Since returning from Australia, she often visited the school, spoke to the students and faculty, and watched with interest the welfare of the institution. With the successful starting of the Avondale school in Australia in a country location, both Ellen White and conference constituency thought in terms of moving the college away from a crowded town to a place where the students would have “more opportunity to engage in agriculture, carpentering, and other lines of manual work” (Letter 141, 1904). At the California Conference session held in February, 1908, a comprehensive resolution was passed calling for the disposal of the school properties in Healdsburg and establishing “an industrial college” in the country that would provide work for students and “furnish at least the agricultural and dairy products necessary for the college home” (Pacific Union Recorder, February 27, 1908).

Consequently conference officials and Ellen White and her staff were on the constant lookout for a suitable place, perhaps with a building on it that could be put to immediate use. At the well-attended Oakland camp meeting in early June, a special session of the California Conference was called. Here on June 9, after considerable discussion and a divided vote, plans to close Healdsburg College were approved and a committee of seven appointed to search for a new site. W. C. White, as well as conference officers, was on this committee. From time to time various sites were examined. In August, a property near Sonoma came to the attention of conference officers. This property, two or three miles north of the town of Sonoma, consisted of 2,900 acres of land, hills, mountains, valleys, and flatlands. On it was a spacious three-story, thirty-eight room mansion called “The Castle” (36 WCW, p. 725; S. N. Haskell to EGW, August 13, 1908). Since the property was less than a mile from a tiny Western Pacific Railway station called Buena Vista, that was the name used in designating it for inspections and negotiations. The estate had been developed by a millionaire, a Mr. Johnson, about twenty-five years earlier, but soon after he had built and furnished the house, and landscaped the grounds with ornamental and fruit trees, he died. His heir squandered his inherited fortune, and the property was sold at auction. Currently it was owned by a Frenchman named Cailleaud (H. W. Cottrell to WCW, March 31, 1909), who felt he had too many land investments and wanted to sell this one. Hetty Haskell, wife of the conference president, described it as “a second Loma Linda, the finest thing we have seen anywhere” (Mrs. S. N.

Measures were taken with the view in mind that at Loma Linda one or two years of medical studies would be given, which might be accepted by a recognized medical college as part of a regular medical course (General Conference Committee Minutes, July 25, 1909 [see also DF 5, Medical Practice and the Educational Program at Loma Linda, p. 74]). It seemed that the next step would be the securing of a charter that would give such work acceptance. Elder Burden, on September 20, 1909, counseled with Ellen White at her home about this. He found that she was distressed with any plan that called for “having medical students take some work at Loma Linda” and then “get the finishing touches of their education from some worldly institution”. She exclaimed, “God forbid that such a plan should be followed,” and commented, “I must state that the light I have received is that we are to stand as a distinct, commandment-keeping people.”—Manuscript 72, 1909."},{"refcode_short":"6BIO 276.1","refcode_long":"Ellen G.

When she arrived, the hall was filled, and 200 people stood outside. “I could not tell what to do,” she wrote later.— Ibid. It was proposed that a few blocks away was a larger hall—the Simpson Auditorium. Hasty arrangements were made for its use, and the crowd flocked to the new location.

Three of the translations were represented in The Great Controversy, but it was discovered that only one had the wholehearted approval of the author. The question now was “Should all the matter quoted from this author be from just the one which had the author's approval?” To do so would call for a good many changes in The Great Controversy text, and in some cases, provide a less desirable wording.

Painstaking research failed to disclose such specific legislation, but edicts were found that did so in effect. Crisler found that one of the British lords, in a debate in Parliament as it opened in January, 1794, declared, after reading at length from French documents, that “The Old and New Testament were publicly burnt, as prohibited books.” “This,” Crisler commented in a letter to W. C. White on October 5, “is quite close to Sister White's declaration, for which we want authentic historical evidence, that ‘it was in 1793 that the decree which prohibited the Bible passed the French Assembly.”’ Crisler continued:"},{"refcode_short":"6BIO 315.2","refcode_long":"Ellen G.
