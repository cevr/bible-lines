He was asked to take a part in a newly built little church near the sawmill, which we passed on our way to get the oranges. He said that he gave Bible readings and that all were deeply interested. Those who have little money bought Steps to Christ and other small books. Here is another field to be worked, and we believe a church will be raised up if the right kind of labor is put forth. But poverty is found everywhere. Many would like to have the books who cannot purchase them, and I am going to create a fund so that those who cannot buy may have the books free of charge. If they cannot have the living preacher, they must have the silent messenger of truth. If you see those who would consider it a privilege to contribute to this fund, please accept and forward their donations. You may thus become a missionary in doing a good work. Tell the people that I invited them to aid me in this missionary project. I will invest twenty-five dollars to start this fund. The Lord is soon to come, and oh how few are being warned!

We did not think of taking lamps with us; but by this morning’s experience in writing before daylight, they would have been of excellent service to us. We found a good dinner waiting for us, and all seemed to eat as if they relished the food. After dinner we went to the riverside, and Brethren Starr, McKenzie, and Collins seated themselves in one boat, Brethren Daniells, McCullagh, and Reekie in a still larger boat, and Willie White, Emily Campbell, and myself in another. We rode several miles upon the water. Though the stream is called Dora Creek, yet it has the appearance of a river, for it is a wide, deep stream. It is somewhat salt, but loses its saltiness as it borders the place which we are investigating. It required two rowers to pull the boat upstream.

The day before, Willie and Brother Reekie had taken their dinner at this place and had kindled a fire in a knot of wood, and it had been burning ever since. There was no danger of setting the woods on fire, and it was a pretty sight. Willie, Emily, and I rested here for a little while, but the rest of the party took their shovels and went on to examine portions of the land that they had not yet passed over. The place where we tarried had a very nice grade. It was a ridge, not abrupt, but slightly elevated. Around us were immense trees that had been cut down, and parts were taken out which could be used.

As he was about to close, I went into the house and talked to them for about thirty minutes. The melting Spirit of the Lord was upon the hearers. Opportunity was then given for all to take a part; but some are very new in the faith, and are very timid.

Brother Corliss packed in the truth, and as he closed his speech, after thoroughly ventilating the fallacies of Barnabas and the Fathers, he said that Mr. Picton reminded him of a story he had read. Pompey and his master were out rowing upon the river, and as the master grew drowsy, he settled himself for a nap, telling Pompey to keep his eye on the North Star and to steer in that direction. Pompey himself grew drowsy, and when he awaked from his sleep, the boat had turned clear around and was headed in the other direction.

Immediate relief was given, the inflammation was stayed, and in a few days he was placed on a spring bed and in a lumber wagon and started on his long journey across the Indian territory en route for Colorado. I told Kellogg to get a quantity of charcoal and give to her to eat and drink, and large poultices of it, covering the stomach and bowels, and it would kill the poison and inflammation.

Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinances and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts?” [Malachi 3:13, 14.] These words describe those who ought to have better represented the precious truth, who ought to have been an example to those newly come to the faith. For all who follow Him the Lord has prepared a rich feast of heavenly things. He has ordained that those who follow Him shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life, and walk in the light as He is in the light, for in Him is no darkness at all. The Lord does not call upon His believing, obedient followers to cover the altar with tears, but to walk cheerfully and happily along. But what complainings are represented by Malachi! These witnesses say, “It is vain to serve God.” What kind of a testimony do they give to the world? They continue, “And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.” [Verse 15.] When anyone who loves and fears God hears men making a similar complaint, let him not respond in giving a testimony against our good and gracious heavenly Father. Malachi turns away from the dark picture which Satan presents to these professed followers of Jesus Christ, for it is a libel on the paternal character of God. Satan has framed this picture for the contemplation of poor, unbelieving, mourning souls, and they have hung it up in memory’s hall where they can gaze upon it. But the Lord has presented another picture for the contemplation of every believer. “Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another; and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and thought upon his name.” [Verse 16.]"},{"refcode_short":"9LtMs, Ms 32, 1894, par. 9","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 9 (1894), Ms 32, 1894, par. 9","content":"Do the believers who meet in their small assemblies in humble churches or in private houses often look upon this picture framed by the Lord of hosts?

We need spirituality in order to discharge our duties in the fear of god. The Bible tells us that when men deliberately turn away from God, the Lord turns away from them. When the Jews did this the Lord said, “Therefore I scattered them with a whirlwind among all nations.” [Zechariah 7:14.] Again, the Lord says, “Them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.” [1 Samuel 2:30.] This is simply a declaration of the effect of a cause, the necessary result of a certain course of action. The Sun of Righteousness will shine upon those who follow in the footsteps of Jesus; he says, “He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life.” [John 8:12.]"},{"refcode_short":"9LtMs, Ms 105, 1894, par. 11","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 9 (1894), Ms 105, 1894, par. 11","content":"We belong to Christ, for he has bought both us and our children.

Those who make up with the world, will be swayed by the principles of the world. The Spirit that works in the heart of the disobedient will work in the hearts of ourselves and our children. The Lord will have the whole heart or nothing. A certain lawyer came to Christ and said, “Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?” He said, “What is written in the law? How readest thou?” And he answering said, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.” And he said unto him, “Thou hast answered right; this do and thou shalt life.” [Luke 10:25-28.] God has plainly revealed the way of salvation, and shall you or I venture to seek to find some other way whereby we may obtain the precious boon of eternal life? God has given to us the opportunity of obtaining light and knowledge, and shall we refuse the message sent from heaven? Shall we refuse the truth because we see that its acceptance would cause us to be separated from those who will not hear the truth or believe in the message of heaven? Shall we make a concession to the world and bind ourselves up with its bundles for the fires of the last days?

They act like disobedient, stubborn children, and then they lay the blame and accusations upon those who are truth-loving and obedient, declaring that they create disunion among neighbors and bring about dissension among families. Christ was accused of creating division in families; he himself said, “Think not that I am come to send peace on the earth; I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law, and a man's foes shall be those of his own household. He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.

The priests and rulers were too proud and self-righteous to admit that their ideas were incorrect and needed remodeling.

As the believing soul receives the truth as it is in Jesus, he obtains a glimpse of the righteousness of Christ in the law, and exclaims, “Open thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.” [Psalm 119:18.] “Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.

It would be very unpleasant to obey your injunctions for it would cause a separation of our interests from that of our neighbors. We know that you have said, “Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you.

You are making a choice that will affect yourselves and your children, not in this life, but in the life that is to come. Your sentiments, your example, the manner in which you treat the plain injunctions of the word of God, the character of your influence is deciding the future destiny of your children who are the property of God, bought with the blood of Jesus Christ. You are leading your children in false paths, teaching them to lightly regard the moral standard which is to measure character. What excuse will you be able to offer when you are called to render up your account to God, when the judgment shall sit and the books be opened and every man be rewarded according to the deeds done in the body? How will your excuses stand in the light of Christ's words? He says, “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets; I am not come to destroy but to fulfill for verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so (by precept or example) shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven.” [Matthew 5:17-19.] In the councils of heaven the violators of the least commandments of God are registered as of least value among men. This decision is pronounced in the councils of the kingdom of heaven to show that not one of these moral precepts is to be trifled with. Men are not to consult their convenience or pleasure when it is a question of obeying God. God will bring them into judgment for disregarding his law. They will not be taken into the kingdom of heaven and treated as inferior subjects; they will never enter the kingdom of heaven, but in that kingdom they are pronounced as the least in all God's creation. God does not regard those who mislead the inexperienced as proper religious teachers. He says, “Whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.” [Verse 19.] Those who do and teach the commandments of God are recognized in heaven as those who are one with Christ and with God, and they are accounted great by the angelic hosts. How careful should we be to obey the commandments of God and exercise our entrusted talents in showing to a disobedient world that we honor God by keeping his law which is a transcript of his character.

Their wicked works were not forgotten nor overlooked; for when the time of retributive judgment was fully due the mandate was sent forth from the sacred place of the Most High for the vindication of God's honor and the magnifying of his law.

If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.” [John 15:18-20.]"},{"refcode_short":"9LtMs, Ms 117, 1894, par. 5","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 9 (1894), Ms 117, 1894, par. 5","content":"Christ draws a sharp distinction between the world and his followers and yet that distinction is becoming obliterated, and instead of the church converting the world, the world is converting the church. When the church walks in the light as Christ is in the light, she will maintain her high ground as a representative of her Lord, and be chosen of God and faithful. The Comforter is the Spirit of truth. In false theories we have a deceptive perversion of truth; but there can be no genuine comfort in falsehood. The spirit of comfort is the Spirit of truth, which exposes error, calls it by its right name, and expels it from the soul. Truth does not exalt finite humanity, but glorifies Christ, and anything that shall make dim or eclipse Christ is a falsehood.

But on this occasion “the seventy returned again with joy, saying Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name. And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.” [Luke 10:17, 18.] When Christ consented to give his soul an offering for the sins of the world, when the controversy ended at the cross, when he cried, “It is finished,” and died under the curse of sin, he made heaven eternally secure against accusations, the deceptions, the pretentions that Satan would instigate. No more would the enemy be able to gain sympathy from the universe of heaven, from worlds unfallen.

All things are delivered to me of my father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him. And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things which ye see; for I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them.” [Verses 21-24.] They received a rich blessing in seeing by faith the invisible. The long promised Messiah, Jesus of Nazareth was among them, and they were commissioned to bear to the world the message of that which they had seen and heard. They were to make known to the people the fact that the Majesty of heaven, the Lord of glory had clothed his divinity in the habiliments of humanity, and had come to the world. Divinity flashed through humanity, transfiguring his countenance as he said, “I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.” [Verse 18.] As he uttered these words the minds of the disciples were illuminated, and they realized that the mighty God, clad in the garb of humanity, was among them. They beheld him as a man, and yet as one infinitely higher than angels, the Creator of all worlds, and equal with the Father in dignity, glory, and blessing.

After the outpouring of the Spirit the disciples realized that “the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.” [John 1:14.] “For verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of Abraham. Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that he himself hath suffered, being tempted, he is able also to succor them that are tempted.” [Hebrews 2:16-18.] Christ takes fallen man, degraded by sin, into unison with deity. The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and this flesh was associated with all the humbling conditions of a fallen race.
