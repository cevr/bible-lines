The word of God came to him, not with the presentation of flattering prospects in this life, of large salary, of great appreciation and worldly honor. “Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee,” was the divine message to Abraham. The patriarch obeyed, and “went out, not knowing whither he went,” as God's light-bearer, to keep his name alive in the earth. He forsook his country, his home, his relatives, and all pleasant associations connected with his early life, to become a pilgrim and a stranger."},{"refcode_short":"T30 5.2","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 30, p. 5.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"It is frequently more essential than many realize, that early associations should be broken up, in order that those who are to speak “in Christ's stead” may stand in a position where God can educate and qualify them for his great work. Kindred and friends often have an influence which God sees will greatly interfere with the instructions he designs to give his servants. Suggestions will be made by those who are not in close connection with Heaven that will, if heeded, turn aside from their holy work those who should be light-bearers to the world."},{"refcode_short":"T30 6.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 30, p. 6.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Before God can use him, Abraham must be separated from his former associations, that he may not be controlled by human influence, or rely upon human aid. Now that he has become connected with God, this man must henceforth dwell among strangers. His character must be peculiar, differing from all the world. He could not even explain his course of action so as to be understood by his friends; for they were idolaters. Spiritual things must be spiritually discerned; therefore his motives and his actions were beyond the comprehension of his kindred and friends."},{"refcode_short":"T30 6.2","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 30, p. 6.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Abraham's unquestioning obedience was one of the most striking instances of faith and reliance upon God to be found in the Sacred Record. With only the naked promise that his descendants should possess Canaan, without the least outward evidence, he followed on where God should lead, fully and sincerely complying with the conditions on his part, and confident that the Lord would faithfully perform his word. The patriarch went wherever God indicated his duty; he passed through wildernesses without terror; he went among idolatrous nations, with the one thought, “God has spoken; I am obeying his voice; he will guide, he will protect me.”"},{"refcode_short":"T30 6.3","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 30, p. 6.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Just such faith and confidence as Abraham had, the messengers of God need today. But many whom the Lord could use will not move onward, hearing and obeying the one Voice above all others. The connection with kindred and friends, the former habits and associations, too often have so great an influence upon God's servants that he can give them but little instruction, can communicate to them but little knowledge of his purposes; and often after a time he sets them aside, and calls others in their place, whom he proves and tests in the same manner.

They are God's messengers to man; and they should never lose sight of their mission or of their responsibilities. They are not like the world; they cannot be like them. If they would be true to God, they must maintain their separate, holy character. If they cease to connect with Heaven, they are in greater danger than others, and can exert a stronger influence in the wrong direction; for Satan has his eye constantly upon them, waiting for some weakness to be developed, whereby he may make a successful attack.

Joseph was maligned and persecuted because he preserved his virtue and integrity. David, that chosen messenger of God, was hunted like a beast of prey by his wicked enemies. Daniel was cast into a den of lions, because he was true and unyielding in his allegiance to God. Job was deprived of his worldly possessions, and so afflicted in body that he was abhorred by his relatives and friends; yet he preserved his integrity and faithfulness to God. Jeremiah would speak the words which God had put into his mouth, and his plain testimony so enraged the king and princes that he was cast into a loathsome pit. Stephen was stoned, because he would preach Christ and him crucified. Paul was imprisoned, beaten with rods, stoned, and finally put to death, because he was a faithful messenger to carry the gospel to the Gentiles.

As the world looks upon these humble men, it cannot discern their moral value with God.

But those heroes of faith have the promise of an inheritance of greater value than any earthly riches,—an inheritance that will satisfy the longings of the soul.

They have a head religion, but no conversion of the heart; and these are the very ones who are the most self-confident and self-sufficient; and this self-sufficiency will stand in the way of their gaining that experience which is essential to make them effective workers in the Lord's vineyard. I wish I could arouse those who claim to be watchmen on the walls of Zion, to realize their responsibility. They should awake, and take a higher stand for God; for souls are perishing through their neglect. They must have that sincere devotion to God that will lead them to see as God sees, and take the words of warning from him and sound the alarm to those who are in peril.

Humility of spirit, combined with earnest activity, will result in the salvation of souls so dearly purchased by the blood of Christ. The minister may understand and believe the theory of truth, and be able to present it to others; but this is not all that is required of him. “Faith without works is dead.” He needs that faith that works by love, and purifies the soul.

The efficiency and power attending a truly converted minister would make the hypocrites in Zion tremble, and sinners afraid. The standard of truth and holiness is trailing in the dust. If those who sound the solemn notes of warning for this time, could realize their accountability to God, they would see the necessity for fervent prayer. When the cities were hushed in midnight slumber, when every man had gone to his own house, Christ, our example, would repair to the Mount of Olives, and there, amid the overshadowing trees, would spend the entire night in prayer. He who was himself without the taint of sin,—a treasure-house of blessing; whose voice was heard in the fourth watch of the night by the terrified disciples upon the stormy sea, in heavenly benediction; and whose word could summon the dead from their graves,—He it was who made supplication with strong crying and tears. He prayed not for himself, but for those whom he came to save. As he became a supplicant, seeking at the hand of his Father fresh supplies of strength, and coming forth refreshed and invigorated as man's substitute, he identified himself with suffering humanity, and gave them an example of the necessity of prayer."},{"refcode_short":"T30 12.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 30, p. 12.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"His nature was without the taint of sin.

As the Prince of life, he had power with God, and prevailed for his people. This Saviour, who prayed for those that felt no need of prayer, and wept for those that felt no need of tears, is now before the throne, to receive and present to his Father the petitions of those for whom he prayed on earth.

The lapse of time has wrought no change in his parting promise to his apostles as he was taken up from them into heaven, “Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.” He has ordained that there should be a succession of men who derive authority from the first teachers of the faith for the continual preaching of Christ and him crucified.

He felt the burdens and sorrows of every tempest-tossed soul; and that earnest prayer included with his living disciples all his followers, to the close of time. “Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word.” Yes; that prayer of Christ embraces even us. We should be comforted by the thought that we have a great Intercessor in the Heavens, presenting our petitions before God. “If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.” In the hour of greatest need, when discouragement would overwhelm the soul, it is then that the watchful eye of Jesus sees we need his help.

When the Amalekites came to attack the camp of Israel in the wilderness, Moses knew that his people were not prepared for the encounter. He sent Joshua with a band of soldiers to meet the enemy, while he himself, with Aaron and Hur, took his position on a hill overlooking the battle-field. There the man of God laid the case before Him who was alone able to give them the victory. With hands outstretched toward heaven, Moses prayed earnestly for the success of the armies of Israel. It was observed that while his hands were reaching upward, Israel prevailed against the foe; but when through fatigue they were allowed to fall, Amalek prevailed.

When Israel triumphed, Moses was reaching his hands toward heaven, and interceding in their behalf; so when all the Israel of God prevail, it is because the Mighty One undertakes their case, and fights their battles for them. Moses did not ask or believe that God would overcome their foes while Israel remained inactive. He marshals all his forces and sends them out as well prepared as their facilities can make them, and then he takes the whole matter to God in prayer. Moses on the mount was pleading with the Lord, while Joshua with his brave followers was below, doing his best to meet and repulse the enemies of Israel and of God."},{"refcode_short":"T30 16.2","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 30, p. 16.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"That prayer which comes forth from an earnest, believing heart is the effectual, fervent prayer that availeth much.

He has some knowledge of those who have been placed under his care; he knows the perversity of the human heart, and realizes the difficulties with which he must contend. But he has learned from experience that in order to have an influence with the people, he must first have power with God. The Lord reads the sincerity and unselfish purpose of the heart of his servant, and condescends to commune with this feeble mortal, face to face, as a man speaketh with a friend.

He pleads with intense earnestness that the Lord will go with him. The answer comes, “My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.” But Moses does not feel that he can stop here. He has gained much, but he longs to come still nearer to God,—to obtain a stronger assurance of his abiding presence. He has carried the burden of Israel; he has borne an overwhelming weight of responsibility; when the people sinned, he suffered keen remorse, as though himself were guilty; and now there presses upon his soul a sense of the terrible results, should God leave Israel to hardness and impenitence of heart. They would not hesitate to kill Moses, and through their own rashness and perversity they would soon fall a prey to their enemies, and thus dishonor the name of God before the heathen.

No earthly power or skill or learning can supply the place of God's immediate presence. In the history of Moses we may see what intimate communion with God it is man's privilege to enjoy. To the transgressor it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.” By another prophet, the Lord gives us the promise, “Ye shall seek me and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.” Again, he speaks of some who “have not cried unto me with their heart.” Such petitions are prayers of form,—lip-service only, which the Lord does not accept."},{"refcode_short":"T30 19.3","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 30, p. 19.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The prayer which Nathaniel offered while he was under the fig-tree, came from a sincere heart, and it was heard and answered by the Master.

True prayer engages the energies of the soul, and affects the life.

The efforts of many of our preachers are not what they should be. When some who lack the Spirit and power of God enter a new field, they commence denouncing other denominations, thinking that they can convince the people of the truth by presenting the inconsistencies of the popular churches. It may seem necessary on some occasions to speak of these things, but in general it only creates prejudice against our work, and closes the ears of many who might otherwise have listened to the truth.

Such men are true heroes."},{"refcode_short":"T30 190.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 30, p. 190.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Many have such meager ideas of what they may become, that they will ever remain dwarfed and narrow, when, if they would improve the powers which God has given them, they might develop a noble character, and exert an influence that would win souls to Christ. Knowledge is power; but intellectual ability, without goodness of heart, is a power for evil."},{"refcode_short":"T30 190.2","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 30, p. 190.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"God has given us our intellectual and moral powers; but to a great extent every person is the architect of his own character. Every day the structure is going up. The word of God warns us to take heed how we build,—to see that our building is founded upon the Eternal Rock. The time is coming when our work will stand revealed just as it is. Now is the time for all to cultivate the powers which God has given them, that they may form characters for usefulness here, and for the higher life hereafter."},{"refcode_short":"T30 190.3","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 30, p. 190.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Every act of life, however unimportant, has its influence in forming the character.

God would have his church a living, devoted, working church. But our people as a body are far from this now. God calls for strong, brave souls, for active, living Christians, who are following the true Pattern, and who will exert a decided influence for God and the right.

May the article be read with care, and may all those who have taken but little or no stock in the Association, who are able to do so, come nobly and liberally up to the work, and thus relieve the Review Office from its present embarrassment.

You are a large class compared with the devoted and self-sacrificing few who took stock liberally at an early date in our history, before calls were made for other institutions. Not one-fifth of our brethren and sisters, who are able to take shares at $10.00 each, all the way from one to twenty, have taken as much as one share. There are no reasons why stock to the amount of $75,000 should not be taken during the year 1881."},{"refcode_short":"T30 192.5","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 30, p. 192.5 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Read carefully and prayerfully pages 99-124, and in the fear of God act a liberal part for the benefit of our publishing houses, which ace the right arm of our strength."}]
