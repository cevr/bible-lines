It is a work that promises rich rewards."},{"refcode_short":"WM 9.2","refcode_long":"Welfare Ministry, p. 9.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Not only by concise, well-worded precept has the author set before us this type of ministry, but through the years, although busy with her home duties and her responsibilities as the messenger of the Lord, she often unwittingly set an example as her heart was drawn out to the needy about her. The autobiographical record of the unselfish ministry of Ellen G. White as a welfare worker, drawn from her diary and letters, as found in the appendix of this volume, will be perused with eager interest and well might be read before the counsels found in the body of the text are studied. Be that as it may, the reader will soon observe that the welfare ministry to which the church is summoned is not merely a community service but a kind of loving ministry and soul-winning endeavor—the highest type of welfare evangelism."},{"refcode_short":"WM 9.3","refcode_long":"Welfare Ministry, p. 9.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In the assembling of Spirit of Prophecy counsels relating to this important field of endeavor, excerpts have been drawn from the vast reservoir of precious instruction penned through seven decades. They have been gathered not only from currently available published books but also from the thousands of E. G. White articles which were prepared for the journals of the denomination, the special testimonies issued in pamphlet form, and the E. G. White manuscript files. Selected as they are from these various sources written at different times, they inevitably bring the reader over the same path he has traversed before, to emphasize some important point vital to a full development of the subject. Such repetition, though reduced to a minimum, cannot be avoided entirely in such a compilation as this, for the compilers are limited in their work to the selecting of the subject matter and the arranging of it in its logical sequence, supplying only the headings."},{"refcode_short":"WM 10.1","refcode_long":"Welfare Ministry, p. 10.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"It has been difficult and well-nigh impossible to bring within the covers of one book the vast amount of instruction Ellen G.

It is not a simple matter to select the material and draw the line between the neighborly visit and the missionary call, nor to separate the work of noble Seventh-day Adventist women in its broader aspects from the more well-defined task undertaken with solely missionary objectives. To the child of God these blend together in the varied activities of daily life."},{"refcode_short":"WM 10.2","refcode_long":"Welfare Ministry, p. 10.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Attention is here called to certain terms occurring frequently in this volume such as “medical missionary work” and “Christian help work.” It should be noted that a careful study of the Ellen G.

They have no excuse for withholding from their neighbors the help that God has put it into their power to provide; and God is dishonored, His character is misinterpreted by Satan, and He is represented as a stern judge who causes suffering to come upon the creatures He has made. This misrepresentation of God's character is made to appear as truth, and thus through the temptation of the enemy men's hearts are hardened against God.

If those whom God has made stewards would but appropriate their Lord's goods to the object for which He gave to them, this state of suffering would not exist.
