The question came from the lips of Christ, “What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man given in exchange for his soul?” [Mark 8:36, 37.] Solemn, fearfully solemn, question! And yet how many are, like Esau, selling their souls for a mess of pottage. And for a man to lose his own soul means more even than this. His words, his example, his evil-spun theories lead others into perplexities and difficulties. He tolls [draws] men away from Christ to rank under the black banner of the prince of darkness.

All the reproaches that fall upon the human believer fall upon Christ in the person of His saints. “I will love him,” said Christ, “and manifest myself to him.” [John 14:21.] Christ is condemned over again in the person of His believing disciples. When for the truth’s sake the believer is incarcerated in prison walls, Christ manifests Himself to him, and ravishes his heart with His love. When he suffers death for the sake of Christ, Christ says to him, They may kill the body, but they cannot hurt the soul. “Be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.” [John 16:33.] They crucified Me, and if they put you to death, they crucify Me afresh in the person of My saints."},{"refcode_short":"11LtMs, Lt 116, 1896, par. 22","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 11 (1896), Lt 116, 1896, par. 22","content":"Persecution cannot do more than cause death, but the life is preserved to eternal life and glory.

We did not want to take out these trees altogether, so Brother Connell puts a rope around his body and after fastening a long ladder about the tree firmly, climbs the ladder, then climbs the straight, smooth trunk until he reaches a limb; then he ties a rope firmly about the tree above the first limb, goes down again to the top of the ladder, and commences to chip the tree with a hatchet he has fastened in the rope about his waist. When he supposes the tree is cut enough he goes down, and the rope is securely fastened low around a strong tree. Then several lay hold of the rope, and down comes the tall top, leaving a pole—the trunk—about thirty feet high.

Your tongue and voice are a talent given you of God to tell the story of His life, of His lessons, of His death, or His resurrection, of His ascension.

There are constant tests, constant temptations, constant trials; but if the agent will bring himself under control of God, and to wise men, every one who acquired a competence more than is sufficient to sustain frugal living and supply his personal wants is thrown upon his own responsibility to acknowledge God as the beneficent giver, and to keep his heart with all diligence to do righteousness."},{"refcode_short":"11LtMs, Ms 25, 1896, par. 20","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 11 (1896), Ms 25, 1896, par. 20","content":"“And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

By their words, by representing Christ in character and life, they should give the invitation of Christ, who is saying, “Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” [Matthew 11:28.] But alas! how much has been done to dishonor God, and to deny Christ by cheap talk, by eager chasing after pleasure, by spending money for selfish gratification. Professed Christians have acted as though there was no burden of responsibility resting upon them to enlighten others, no need of self-denial that souls might be saved. But the example of Christ is before us, and nothing should be done to lessen the efficiency of the gospel."},{"refcode_short":"11LtMs, Ms 82, 1896, par. 9","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 11 (1896), Ms 82, 1896, par. 9","content":"God call upon those who profess his name to seek for true conversion. Many are at ease, and they know not what it is to experience true religion. “Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near.” [Isaiah 55:6.] Let every voice say, “Come,” let every influence and ability be exercised to win souls to the Lord. You cannot be too enthusiastic, you cannot be too much in earnest in seeking to save that which is lost. Not one is excused from the work, though he may be able to do but little; for through the doing of what he has ability to do, he may gain courage and faith and grace to do a larger work."},{"refcode_short":"11LtMs, Ms 82, 1896, par. 10","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 11 (1896), Ms 82, 1896, par. 10","content":"Instead of learning to work in the way that Christ would have us, many have wasted their time in foolish talking and pursuits, they have lived to please themselves, and have not laid up their treasures above. Let not such think that to them will be said, “Well done, thou good and faithful servant. Thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things.” [Matthew 25:21.] The words appropriate to their cases will be, “You have been attentive to self, lived to please and favor and glorify self, and your portion must be with unbelievers. You have chosen to be like them in words and actions. You did not deny self for my sake. You were not obedient to my commandments, and I cannot receive you into my kingdom. You wasted your opportunities, and did not value the probationary time I graciously gave you to form characters for eternal life. You did not have respect unto the recompense of reward. You have not loved me who died for you, but have refused to comply with the conditions upon which the heavenly benefit was conferred. You refused to come out from the world and to be separate, and touch not the unclean, although I promised to be a Father unto you, and pledged my word that you should be my sons and daughters, members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King. You despised my words, and cared not for my entreaties. The disposition which led you to do this in probationary time is unchanged, although I declared to you that as your Redeemer, I was able to save unto the uttermost all that came unto God by me. You did not come, but drew apart from me, and chose other associates, and loved other society. Though I had chosen you, you had not chosen me, and you have made your own choice.”"},{"refcode_short":"11LtMs, Ms 82, 1896, par. 11","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 11 (1896), Ms 82, 1896, par. 11","content":"“When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left. Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer him saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. Then shall he say unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: for I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.

Thus is it with the Sun of Righteousness. More and more distinctly the believer may discern his mission, his mercy, his love and tender compassion. Christ is admired in all that believe, he is more and more loved, more and more implicitly obeyed, and devotedly served. We behold the light of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! Behold this wisdom as it shines in the plan of salvation, as God seeks to recover lost man from his degradation and ruin. What a marvel it is that man will choose and cling to delusions! What a wonder that he will be infatuated with things that are passing away, while he neglects the imperishable treasure!"}]
