Your heart beats on. On that pulsation depends your life. Its beating is independent of your will. You eat and sleep in careless indifference. But God’s guardian care over you is unceasing. He controls the ebb and flow of the vital current. Where is the gratitude that should rise from human lips for His preserving care? Where is the recognition of His unceasing watchfulness? Why does not thankfulness flow forth from the life in gratitude-offerings? Why do not springs of joy well up in the heart?

If a worker does not follow the plan of work that another thinks is right, this should not cause difference and alienation.

I spoke twice in the church at San Diego, on Sabbath and Sunday afternoons. I had a burden for this church; and after speaking for one hour, I presented their needs before God in prayer. The Holy Spirit was in the meetings, and hearts were impressed. Confessions were made by a few. There were many present whose hearts should have been broken; and had they realized their true condition, they would have cleared the King’s highway. What was needed was humiliation of heart and confession of sin, in order to remove the difficulties. But this chapter in their experience, though much needed, did not come. We left this place, sorry that they did not all clear the King’s highway.

Some seem too ready to advocate this man or that man or the other man. Such a spirit has been revealed by many. You know there are different sentiments and different temperaments, and all these peculiar conditions have made it difficult for those in responsibility to know how to manage; and yet it would be a very unwise thing, Brother Reaser, for you to feel free to question certain things and give to the people a feeling of uncertainty regarding matters over which they should have no doubt. When doing such work, you are sowing seeds. You may not realize any fruit just at present, but you are sowing seeds that will bear fruit. We must cultivate a spirit of unity. We must strive for unity in following the gospel Pattern—Christ Jesus. There is nothing, nothing that we can present to the people that will be of greater value than to present Christ and to study what He would do under like circumstances. And if we present Christ, and strive to labor in the bonds of Christian unity, one party will not be set up against another.

This position of presidency is not that the one man is to rule the conference, but be a helper with others who, as wise men, bear a position of trust. Christ has appointed ministers to stand as His mouthpiece to the people, to see and sense what the people need in spiritual lines, and they are conversant by long experience with the necessities of the work of a conference president. The work of a president of the conference is to be defined. There has often been a mistake in placing a man as president of a conference, unless he has a company of men appointed to be responsible for that man’s workings in the conference. One man’s mind and one man’s judgment is not to control any conference, for it would spoil the man. One who is young and inexperienced is not to stand forth in self-sufficiency. He must have as many as seven men to consult, men of experience to advise and counsel with. To be placed as president of a conference for the first time does not make a man efficient. Unless he has the advice and counsel of wise men, who have been entrusted with responsibilities and are proved men to counsel with, he will be liable to make erratic moves in self-confidence."},{"refcode_short":"22LtMs, Ms 157, 1907, par. 13","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 22 (1907), Ms 157, 1907, par. 13","content":"Righteousness is absolute conformity to God’s mind.

Here was the world lying in sin, corruption, and Satan was having things after his own way, and here he was taking possession of the hearts and souls of the people, and the bodies, and Christ saw that it was time for Him to reveal Himself. And Christ the royal priest of heaven, the royal King, laid aside His royal robe, laid off His royal crown, and clothed His divinity with humanity. He came here as a humble child in this world, and was a child of poverty. Why? So that no sinner should say, He does not know that temptations I have passed through.

His own relatives tried to get Christ to leave the suffering multitude that kept coming, coming, till He had no time to eat, no time to rest, and they were calling for Him, but He did not answer the call. His relatives wanted to get Him away. But Christ had an opportunity to sow the seed of the Word in the hearts of those who came, not knowing which should prosper, this or that. Nevertheless He would go through the process, just as we have to go though the process. We have to carry the truth to every place where we can find entrance. Now it is the duty of every soul here to improve your talents to the very best of your ability.

But they hunted and hunted, and they could not find the sheep. In the morning they went to wake up Garibaldi; but where was he? He was doing a thing that was not natural to him; he was sleeping late in the morning, and he was an early riser; therefore they came to see what was the trouble. Well, he aroused himself, and they said, “We cannot find the sheep that was lost.” He laid down the clothing, and there was the sheep right by his side. He had hunted through the night in every place until he found it, and there he had the sheep right there by his side. Now that is a wonderful incident. We want every one of us to so keep Christ in view, to bring back to His name the glory of our salvation, and more than that, He wants you to arouse and waken others to their souls’ interest, that they also may see the preciousness of Christ, and what He has done in their behalf."},{"refcode_short":"22LtMs, Ms 184, 1907, par. 11","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 22 (1907), Ms 184, 1907, par. 11","content":"The children in this age of the world are generally left to come up without proper instruction.

And, O, this beautiful place! I feel thankful to have the privilege now and then of coming in and speaking a few words of encouragement to them. And I want to say to every one of you, There is a heaven to win and a hell to shun. And we have our privilege of choice. We are not forced to go to heaven, but if we will accept of the infinite sacrifice that was made in our behalf by Jesus Christ, if we will accept it, as we claim many to have done by baptism, we come up out of the water, and then what is said? Ye are dead; buried with Christ in baptism, risen with Christ from the grave as you arise out of the water. Then “seek those things that are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God.” [Colossians 3:1.] And He will take you and let His blessing rest upon you. Now I am going to read a few words, then I will stop. Daniel 1:3-8. “Purposed in his heart.” Christ wants every man to purpose in his heart that he will not soil his brain power on any account whatever, but cherish it, that he may do the work of the Lord."},{"refcode_short":"22LtMs, Ms 186, 1907, par. 39","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 22 (1907), Ms 186, 1907, par. 39","content":"Verse 9.
