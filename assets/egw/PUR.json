As we look unto Jesus, beholding the glorious spectacle of the love and tenderness of God, there springs up in our hearts a desire to engage in active service for the Master.

Heaven is brought into the home by our eating the bread of life, receiving and practising Christ's words. Thus we are to eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of God. “The flesh profiteth nothing,” He said, “the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life.” The Word of God is life, eternal life, to the receiver. As the human elements in the soul are softened and subdued by the lessons of Christ, the great love wherewith He hath loved us fills the mind with gratitude, which finds expression in thanksgiving and praise. His Word is to be an active element in the family circle. When its influence is diffused through the household, it not only reveals Christ in the home, but its bright rays extend to the neighborhood. When the heart is imbued with the Holy Spirit, the gratitude which springs up must find expression. Loving sympathy is manifested in word and action."},{"refcode_short":"PUR August 1,  1901, Art.

He has made human beings His stewards. They are to employ His intrusted talents in building up His work and enlarging His kingdom. Our churches, large and small, are not to be treated in such a way that they will be helplessly dependent upon ministerial aid. The members are to be so established in the faith that they will have an intelligent knowledge of true missionary work. They are to follow Christ's example, ministering to those around them. Faithfully they are to fulfil the vows made at their baptism, the vow that they will practise the lessons taught in the life of Christ.

Then we shall see the missionary work, in all its branches, evangelical and medical, broadening and deepening at every point of its progress, because of the inflowing of hundreds and thousands of streams, until the whole earth is covered as the waters cover the sea. Our ministers are displeasing God by the feebleness of their efforts to let the truth shine forth to the world. Nothing so strengthens the churches as to see the work progressing in other portions of the vineyard.

When church members stand pledged to the service of God, pledged to do missionary work; when they take hold of the work unselfishly, because they love the souls for whom Christ died, and are desirous of uniting with the Great Missionary, He will come very near to them to instruct them. Life is full of opportunities for the practical missionary. Every man, woman, and child can sow each day the seeds of kind words and unselfish deeds. The world is not a playground where we are to amuse ourselves; it is a school in which we are to study earnestly and thoroughly the lessons given in the Word of God. There we may learn how to receive and how to impart. There we may learn how to seek for souls in the highways and byways of life. If those who engage so earnestly in the games of this world would strive as earnestly for the crown of life which fadeth not away, what victories they would gain! They would become true missionaries, and would see how much could be done to relieve suffering humanity. What a blessing this would be! What we need is practical education.

Hers was the comfort that causes a child of the great Father of love and light to fear no evil, even while passing through the valley of the shadow of death. Not infrequently, during the earlier weeks of her illness, her voice was lifted in song: “We have heard from the bright, the holy land, we have heard, and our hearts are glad; for we are a lonely pilgrim band, and weary, and worn, and sad. They tell us the pilgrims have a dwelling there— no longer are homeless ones; and we know that the goodly land is fair, where life's pure river runs. “we'll be there, we'll be there, in a little while, we'll join the pure and the blest; we'll have the palm, the robe, the crown; and forever be at rest.” [In singing this hymn, Sister White always followed the phraseology of the hymnal published by her husband in 1849.]"},{"refcode_short":"PUR July 22,  1915, par. 15","refcode_long":"Pacific Union Recorder July 22,  1915, paragraph 15","content":"Arrangements have been made for the holding of a funeral service at her home, “Elmshaven,” near the St. Helena Sanitarium, at five o'clock Sunday afternoon, July 18.

Of the countless hearts turned heavenward through her public ministry and through the influence of her writings, it is needless to say more than that during her last sickness her own heart turned in loving solicitude toward the thousands whose prayers in her behalf she knew were ascending to the throne of grace, and whom she hoped soon to greet in the blessed hereafter."}]
