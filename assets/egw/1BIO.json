(Willie) and Ethel May White on October 6, 1907. He grew up in picturesque Pratt Valley, just below the St. Helena Sanitarium in Northern California. This small valley cradled not only the W. C. White home but Elmshaven, the home of Ellen White, and several others. Arthur attended the nearby ten-grade church school and then continued his education at Pacific Union College. He received a certificate in business administration in 1928 and that same year was united in marriage with a classmate, Frieda Belle Swingle. The newlyweds moved to Madison College in Tennessee, he to serve as assistant accountant and she as secretary to college and hospital personnel."},{"refcode_short":"1BIO 7.2","refcode_long":"Ellen G.

The latter was one of five church leaders appointed by Ellen White in her will to administer her estate; when Arthur joined him in 1929 he was secretary of the Board of Trustees. During the next nine years Arthur was given increasing responsibilities, and in 1933 he was appointed assistant secretary of the Board. Shortly after the death of W. C.

Hesitant because of his personal relationship to the subject of the biography, but conditioned by his stance taken early in his ministry that he would relate to Ellen White as would any other loyal Seventh-day Adventist, viewing her as “Sister White” and not as “my grandmother,” he accepted the assignment. In 1978 he resigned as secretary of the Ellen G. White Estate to devote his energies almost exclusively to the biography project. Adhering to a careful schedule, he produced one volume each year, doing his work largely in his study at home, where he could give undivided attention to research and writing while at the same time maintaining easy access to the rich sources in the White Estate vault."},{"refcode_short":"1BIO 8.3","refcode_long":"Ellen G.

As nichol was about to take up the writing itself, with the assistance of Arthur L. White, the secretary of the Ellen G. White Estate, he died suddenly from a dissecting aneurysm. The board of trustees then, in October, 1966, asked arthur White to undertake the task. A beginning was made as his responsibilities as secretary of the White Estate allowed.

See Appendix A for the genealogical records of her immediate progenitors. A comprehensive “family tree” is available from the Ellen G. White Estate.] Ellen's grandfather Daniel had been a corporal in the Revolutionary War. Her great-grandfather John had married an Irish woman; they were the first of the Harmons to settle in Standish, Maine. Ellen's great-great-grandfather Samuel had been a landowner in comfortable circumstances in Scarboro, Maine, where he built a mill on the river, known as “Harmon's Mill.” Ellen's great-great-great-grandfather John served in King Philip's War, which broke out in 1675. He fought the Indians in “the great swamp fight,” then as a reward was given a grant of land in Maine. He moved to Scarboro in 1726 and was one of the organizers of the First Congregational Church. Most of the Harmons were Congregationalists, but Robert, Ellen's father, broke the tradition. He became a Methodist."},{"refcode_short":"1BIO 18.2","refcode_long":"Ellen G.

Articles that follow carry the titles “The Voice of God,” “The Time of Trouble,” “The Time of Jacob's Trouble,” and “Thoughts on Revelation 14.” Thus, as Ellen White indicated in the early 1880s (Testimonies for the Church, 1:78, 79), the early believers understood clearly the intent of the first and second angels’ messages, but as to the third, which mentions the “commandments of God” and makes references to “the beast” and “his image,” there seemed to be considerable haziness. However, James wrote, “It is plain that we live in the time of the third angel's message.”—A Word to the Little Flock, 11.

As the sanctuary in heaven was studied, the Sabbath of the fourth commandment took on special meaning. The visions given to Ellen White helped to clarify this. The Sabbath would be a test of allegiance to God, and as worship of the “beast and his image” and the receiving of his “mark” (Revelation 14:9, 10) became better understood, the pioneers saw it as “present truth” and were confronted with the responsibility of sounding that message to the world.

In a comprehensive presentation that filled nearly two pages, James defended the proposition of the gift of prophecy in the church, but he did not mention Ellen White. By mid-June, 1851, the growing number of church members were calling for the visions in published form. This led him to plan for the issuance of Extras of the Review just for the believers.

To avoid prejudicing those they hoped to reach with the third angel's message through the Review and Herald, they had published none of the visions in the paper for nearly five years, and only twice had James White referred to the visions in his articles or editorials.

And so it is through the entire volume, with such expressions as “I was shown,” or “I saw,” or the equivalent, averaging once for each page of the book. The account passes from Creation very briefly down through the experiences of Old Testament history, touching those points prominent in the conflict between the forces of good and of evil. It traverses in more detail the life and ministry of Jesus and the experience of the apostles. At this point Ellen White goes beyond the Bible records and describes the apostasy, at times in symbolic representations. Then she moves into a brief chapter on the Reformation, describing what she saw of the ministry of Martin Luther and Melanchthon. This represented the conflict through post-Biblical centuries, and bridged the story to the Advent movement. Twenty chapters fill the last half of the book and trace the history, past and future, to the new earth.

Mrs. Smith remained faithful, and the Review and Herald Came weekly to their home. Then one day Smith picked it up and read an article from Ellen White. He continued to read her weekly articles and found they spoke to his heart, and he began to soften."},{"refcode_short":"1BIO 491.3","refcode_long":"Ellen G.

Farnsworth, son of William Farnsworth, of Washington, New Hampshire, was holding revival meetings in the little Washington Church. Smith had known him as a boy, and he walked twelve miles to attend the sabbath meeting. He heard farnsworth preach on the rise and development of the remnant church. The sermon over, Smith Rose to his feet and asked for the privilege of speaking. The audience, who knew him well, expected a perfect blast of criticism and meanness."},{"refcode_short":"1BIO 491.4","refcode_long":"Ellen G.

I have quit that kind of business.” Then he reviewed the past, his hatred of church organization, his joining one opposition party after another, which he had seen go down and their sympathizers come to confusion. “Facts,” said he, “are stubborn things, but the facts are that those who have opposed this work have come to naught, while those who have been in sympathy with it have prospered, have grown better, more devoted and godlike. Those who have opposed it have learned only to fight and debate. They have lost all their religion."},{"refcode_short":"1BIO 491.5","refcode_long":"Ellen G.

I want to be in fellowship with this people in heart and in the church.” Smith intended to stay over in Washington for the meeting on the next Sabbath, but on Wednesday he thought of the letter from Ellen White in his trunk at home. Feeling he could not wait to read it, he started out early Thursday morning and trudged the twelve miles home and soon had the unopened envelope in his hands. He tore it open and read its contents."},{"refcode_short":"1BIO 492.1","refcode_long":"Ellen G.

But to my sorrow, I found the visions were right, and the man who thought he knew it all was all wrong, for I preached the time in 1854, and spent all I had when if I had heeded them, I should have saved myself all that and much more.
