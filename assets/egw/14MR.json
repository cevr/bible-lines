When David offended against God by numbering the people, one angel caused that terrible destruction by which his sin was punished.

Then some remarks were made by those who were talking to me, in regard to several matters connected with the past year's work. They said that you, Brother Cady, had overdrawn your account, and also that the conference had been paying the traveling expenses of the canvassers who were selling Christ's Object Lessons, which expenses were so great that almost as much was consumed as was produced.

Those who have had charge of the school have not felt the importance of putting brain, bone, and muscle to the tax in an effort to make the school a success. The students who attend this school are to be given an education that will fit them to work for the Master. They are to be given more than book knowledge.

When a man has occupied the same position for years, and yet the school, in its inside and outside working, is still far from what it ought to be, a change must be made.

Oh, that they would seek to understand what is due from man to God!"},{"refcode_short":"14MR 350.3","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 14 [Nos. 1081-1135], p. 350.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I tell you in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, that there must be an individual reformation. Unless men reveal Christlikeness in all their dealings with their fellow men, unless they obey the law of heaven in every particular, they will never enter the city of God. There is no excuse for anyone to fail. Christ's character is before all, for study and imitation."},{"refcode_short":"14MR 350.4","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 14 [Nos. 1081-1135], p. 350.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"When, like Christ, men manifest good will toward men, the truth will sanctify the soul. But preaching the truth while the practice is corrupt makes the truth of none effect. God is dishonored by those who honor Him in theory only."},{"refcode_short":"14MR 350.5","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 14 [Nos. 1081-1135], p. 350.5 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"If one does a piece of work which is not wholly perfect, shall his brethren pull it to pieces, speaking of it scathingly and contemptuously? The one who has made mistakes may be doing his very best. Did Christ treat the work of His disciples thus? If He should treat erring human beings as their shortcomings deserve, what would become of them? Well may every mortal say, “Let me fall into the hands of the living God, rather than into the hands of men.” God is too wise to err, and too good to do us harm."},{"refcode_short":"14MR 351.1","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 14 [Nos. 1081-1135], p. 351.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"There are those who are driven away from Christ by the harshness of professing Christians. They might have done a good work in saving souls, but they have been stung to death by the inconsistency of those claiming to follow Christ, those who are Christians in name only. These weave into the web of life unsightly threads of selfishness, but their eyes are not anointed with the heavenly eyesalve, therefore they assert that the pattern is correct. But the threads of selfishness are there."},{"refcode_short":"14MR 351.2","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 14 [Nos. 1081-1135], p. 351.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"To some it appears degrading to wear Christ's yoke of submission and obedience. Many prefer to wear the yokes which they have manufactured for themselves. They choose the way that seems right in their own eyes. Their actions testify that they have not an experimental knowledge of God."},{"refcode_short":"14MR 351.3","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 14 [Nos. 1081-1135], p. 351.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Those who are connected with God's service should be sanctified, soul, body, and spirit, else they will mar God's work and put Christ to open shame. What does God's Word mean when it declares that Christ will present to Himself a church without spot or wrinkle or any such thing? It means that God's people can and must reach the standard of Christian perfection. But in order to do this they must learn of Christ His meekness and lowliness. “This is life eternal,” the Saviour said, “that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.”"},{"refcode_short":"14MR 351.4","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 14 [Nos. 1081-1135], p. 351.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Study the instruction given in the first chapter of First Peter. It points out to us the source of our strength. By the sacrifice of Christ every provision has been made for believers to receive all things that pertain to life and godliness. God calls upon us to reach the highest standard of glory and virtue. The perfection of Christ's character makes it possible for us to gain perfection."},{"refcode_short":"14MR 352.1","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 14 [Nos. 1081-1135], p. 352.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"He who desires to rise to true greatness must walk humbly before God, not with a forced humility, but with a genuine sense of his own inefficiency and of God's greatness.

We are getting short of provisions. We got him the best we could for his meals on the way. He was to send Mr. Walling immediately and to get our mail. A young man from Nova Scotia had come in from hunting. He had a quarter of deer. He had traveled 20 miles with this deer upon his back. The remainder of the deer he had left hung up in the woods. He saw six elk but did not try to shoot them as he knew he could not carry them out. He gave us a small piece of the meat, which we made into broth. Willie shot a duck which came in a time of need, for our supplies were rapidly diminishing.—Manuscript 11, 1873."}]
