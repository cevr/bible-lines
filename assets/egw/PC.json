We must give close attention to eating, drinking, and dressing. The entire body of believers needs to make a decided reform. A high profession, followed by a disregard of the laws of life, shows a faithless life. Lack of fidelity, want of stability, slavery to wrong habits,—this is the sure result of such a course. Those who follow this course are not consistent Christians. Salvation means deliverance from every habit which tends to drag humanity down.

I am now seventy-eight years old. I am grateful to my heavenly Father that I am able to do my writing. My appetite is excellent. We have been favored with Brother and Sister King to be our helpers. Both are very useful workers. Sister King is my cook, and the food comes on to the table in an appetizing shape for my workers. This is what we need: simple food prepared in a simple, wholesome and relishable manner. We have no butter and no meat on our table. We do not think fried potatoes are healthful, for there is more or less grease or butter used in preparing them. Good baked or boiled potatoes served up with cream and a sprinkling of salt are more healthful. The remnants of Irish and sweet potatoes are prepared with a little cream and salt and rebaked, and not fried; they are excellent. I have had a good appetite and relish my food, and am perfectly satisfied with the portion which I select, which I know does not injure my digestive organs. Others can eat food which I can not, such as lentils and beans. We are favored with the services of Brother and Sister King; they are a blessing to us, and we are thankful for their help. Sister Nelson was highly prized as our housekeeper and cook, and we would have kept her if she would have remained. She wished to perfect her education as a nurse, which position she will fill and do good service. This was understood when she came to us. We were troubled at the thought of her leaving us, as she had done good service and was an excellent caretaker both indoors and out of doors. We thought it would be difficult to supply her place, but it would not be doing Sister Nelson justice to keep her here when she desired a change and we considered that she ought to have it. So I let her go. I am glad and thankful that we have secured Sister King, as the matron of our home, and her husband to be a care-taker outside of the home and inside when needed.

But it has proved a still more difficult matter to secure persons who were qualified to conduct such institutions. It requires thoroughly balanced characters to do this work, not men who have some strong traits of character, but who are weak as children in other points. Plenty of physicians can be obtained who ceased to be students when they received their diplomas, who are self-inflated, who feel that they know all that is worth knowing, and what they do not know is not worth knowing. But this class are not the ones we want. When a physician enters upon his work as a practitioner, the more genuine, practical experience he has, the more fully will he feel his want of knowledge. If self-sufficient, he will read articles written in regard to disease and how to treat them without nature's aid; he will grasp statements and weave them into his practice, and without deep research, without earnest study, without sifting every statement, he will merely become a mechanical worker. Because he knows so little, he will be ready to experiment upon human lives, and sacrifice not a few. This is murder, actual murder. He did not do this work with evil design, he had no malicious purposes; but life was sacrificed on account of his ignorance, because he was a superficial student, because he had not had that practice that would make him a safe man to be entrusted with human lives. It requires care-taking, deep, earnest taxation of the mind to carry the burden a physician should carry in learning his trade thoroughly. Every physician who has received a thorough education will be modest in his claims. It will not do for him to run any risk upon experimenting on human life, lest he be guilty of murder, and this be written against him in the books of heaven. There should be a careful, competent physician who will deal scarcely ever in drugs, and who will not boast that powerful poisons are far more effective than a smaller quantity carefully taken, It is true, it kills, if it does not cure; but drugs never cure.

The greatest good can be done by our trying to enlighten the minds of all we can obtain access to, as to the best course for them to pursue to prevent sickness and suffering, and broken constitutions, and premature death; but those who do not care to undertake work that taxes their physical and mental powers will be ready to prescribe drug medication, which lays a foundation in the human organism for a two-fold greater evil than that which they claim to have relieved."},{"refcode_short":"PC 22.1","refcode_long":"The Paulson Collection of Ellen G.

The common use of the flesh of dead animals has had a deteriorating influence upon the morals, as well as the physical constitution. Ill-health in a variety of forms, if effect could be traced to the cause, would reveal the sure result of flesh eating. The disuse of meats, with healthful dishes nicely prepared to take the place of flesh meats, would place a large number of the sick and suffering ones in a fair way of recovering their health, without the use of drugs. But if the physicians encourage a meat-eating diet to his invalid patients, then he will make a necessity for the use of drugs. Nature will want some assistance to bring things to their proper condition, which may be found in the simplest remedies, especially in the use of nature's own furnished remedies,—pure air, and with a precious knowledge of how to breathe; pure water, with a knowledge of how to apply it; plenty of sunlight in every room, if possible, in the house, and with an intelligent knowledge of what advantages are to be gained by its use. All these are powerful in their efficiency, and the patient who has obtained a knowledge of how to eat and dress healthfully, may live for comfort, for peace, for health; and will not be prevailed upon to put to his lips drugs, which, in the place of helping nature, paralyzes her powers.

Lift off the burdens placed upon her, after the customs of the fashion of this age, and you will see in many cases nature will right herself. The use of drugs is not favorable or natural to the laws of life and health. The drug medication gives nature two burdens to bear, in the place of one. She has two serious difficulties to overcome, in the place of one. There is now positive need even with physicians, reformers in the line of treatment of disease, that greater painstaking effort be made to carry forward and upward the work for themselves, and to interestedly instruct those who look to them for medical skill to ascertain the cause of their infirmities. They should call their attention in a special manner to the laws which God has established, which can not be violated with impunity. They dwell much on the working of disease, but do not, as a general rule, arouse the attention to the laws which must be sacredly and intelligently obeyed in such to prevent disease. Especially if the physician has not been correct in his dietetic practices, if his own appetite has not been restricted to a plain, wholesome diet, in a large measure discarding the use of the flesh of dead animals,—he loves meat, he has educated and cultivated a taste for unhealthful food. His ideas are narrow, and he will as soon educate and discipline the taste and appetite of his patients to love the things that he loves, as to give them the sound principles of health reform. He will prescribe for sick patients, flesh-meats, when it is the very worst diet that they can have; it stimulates, but does not give strength. They do not inquire into their former habits of eating and drinking, and take special notice of their erroneous habits which have been for many years laying the foundation of disease. Conscientious physicians should be prepared to enlighten those who are ignorant, and should with wisdom make out their prescriptions, prohibiting those things in their diet which he knows to be erroneous. He should plainly state the things which he regards as detrimental to the laws of health, and leave these suffering ones to work conscientiously to do those things for themselves which they can do, and thus place themselves in the right relation to the laws of life and health. When from an enlightened conscience they do the very best they know how to do, to preserve themselves in health, then in faith they may look to the great Physician, who is a healer of the body as well as of the soul. We are health reformers. Physicians should have wisdom and experience, and be thorough health reformers. Then they will be constantly educating by precept and example their patients from drugs. For they well know that the use of drugs may produce for the time being favorable results, but which will implant in the system that which will cause great difficulties hereafter, which they may never recover from during their lifetime.

To resort to the drugging process lays upon nature a most fearful, merciless burden from which they may never recover. There are many laboring under chronic diseases.

How can they, then, consistently enlighten the understanding of those who indulge in the poisonous narcotic, tobacco?

Let everyone who contemplates erecting an institution, carefully consider whether they are to make it an institution conducted upon the principles of health reform, or whether they design to copy the popular institutions all through our land. If an institution for health is conducted upon the principles of health reform, it will require for its management a large amount of faith, large amount of patience, a large amount of perseverance, a large amount of moral power, such as they have scarcely dreamed of, to make such an institution a success and to pay its own way. The managers will require moral backbone, as well as superior educated skill. Lectures need to be given in such an institution every day upon some points connected with the custom and habits of the people, of disease and its causes, and the only true course to be taken to prevent disease.

While trying to educate them away from the habits and customs of the world, many will be glad to be enlightened, while many who are wedded to their own fashionable, health-destroying indulgences will be offended, and make it very unpleasant for those who wish to do them good; and some have not the moral courage to keep right on in the fear of the Lord. There is even among those who have intelligence in regard to the laws of life and health, a constant selfish indulgence in those things which are injurious to both soul and body. There is intemperance in eating, and in the many varieties of food taken at one meal. In the preparation of food, there are unhealthful mixtures which ferment in the stomach, and cause great distress. And yet these go on, continuing their indulgence, which lays the foundation for numerous difficulties. If these would have self-control, and educate their taste to eat only those things which the abused stomach can and will assimilate, they would save large expense in doctor bills, and avoid great sufferings."},{"refcode_short":"PC 25.1","refcode_long":"The Paulson Collection of Ellen G.

Every such institution should have as its managers and helpers the very best talents that the world can produce. Then they will have an educating school and be thoroughly disciplined and fitted, that representatives shall be sent out to any part of the world to impart their knowledge to those who are ignorant, and who greatly need it. This drill is to be kept up, until men and women are prepared to do the very best kind of work as educators, as well as all the time to be learning themselves, disciplining their powers to obtain increased knowledge, that they may as stewards of God have wisdom and light, that they can impart, too, that they are connected with in any branch of the work."},{"refcode_short":"PC 26.1","refcode_long":"The Paulson Collection of Ellen G.

If they knew themselves better, they would have a sense of their inefficiency; they would grasp the higher rounds of the ladder, without climbing with painstaking efforts round after round to reach this elevation. It is much easier to boast than to execute. In these institutions we have it (illegible corrections) a most puzzling question how to keep managers and helpers in harmonious working order. The very best kind of material is needed for the upbuilding of institutions for the sick. We have had an experience from the first establishment of the institution in the city of Battle Creek, and in the institution at St. Helena, and we feel compelled to say that it has cost much time and great amount of perplexity, and quite an amount of money, to get these institutions in working order. There have been counsels and painful reproofs given, most earnest entreaties and appeals made; one set of workmen discharged because inefficient, and others have been placed in their place. Step by step a little has been gained here and there. There has been much said in order to keep out licentious practices and improper familiarity between men and women. This has to be met and reproved, and constantly guarded against, and the ones that are corrected become angry; in the place of reforming, they try to work their revenge upon the faithful workers in the institution.

We were just preparing to leave Texas, where we had been laboring for several months, and we had carriages prepared to take away this brother and his family, and several others who were suffering from malarial fever. My husband and I thought we would stand this expense rather than have heads of several families die and leave their wives and children unprovided for. Two or three were taken in a spring wagon on spring mattresses. But this man who was suffering from inflammation of the bowels, sent for me to come to him. My husband and I decided that it would not do to move him. Fears were entertained that mortification had set in. Then the thought came to me like a communication from the Lord to take pulverized charcoal, put water upon it, and give this water to the sick man to drink, putting bandages of the charcoal over the bowels and stomach. We were about one mile from the city of Denison, but the sick man's son went to a blacksmith's shop, secured the charcoal, and pulverized it, and then used it according to the directions given. The result was that in half an hour there was a change for the better. We had to go on our journey and leave the family behind, but what was our surprise the following day to see their wagon overtake us. The sick man was lying in a bed in the wagon.

She cannot sleep, and every breath seems as though it would be her last. We prayed for her, and then like a flash of lightning there came to me the thought of the charcoal. “Send to the blacksmith for charcoal, and pulverize it, I said, “and put a poultice of it on her side.” He tried this, and in one hour he came to me and said, “That prescription was an inspiration from God.

If all should do this, their time would be fully employed,—they could do nothing else; but the Lord gives us the privilege of seeking Him individually in earnest prayer, of unburdening our souls to Him, keeping nothing from Him who has invited us, “Come unto me, all ye who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” O how grateful we should be that Jesus is willing and able to bear all our infirmities and strengthen and heal all our diseases if it will be for our good and for His glory.

I must become acquainted with myself, I must be a learner always as to how to take care of this building, the body God has given me, that I may preserve it in the very best condition of health. I must eat those things which will be for my very best good physically, and I must take special care to have my clothing such as will conduce to a healthful circulation of the blood. I must not deprive myself of exercise and air. I must get all the sunlight that it is possible for me to obtain. I must have wisdom to be a faithful guardian of my body. I should do a very unwise thing to enter a cool room when in a perspiration; I should show myself an unwise steward to allow myself to sit in a draught, and thus expose myself so as to take cold. I should be unwise to sit with cold feet and limbs and thus drive back the blood from the extremities to the brain or internal organs. I should always protect my feet in damp weather. I should eat regularly of the most healthful food which will make the best quality of blood, and I should not work intemperately if it is in my power to avoid doing so. And when I violate the laws God has established in my being, I am to repent and reform, and place myself in the most favorable condition under the doctors God has provided,—pure air, pure water, and the healing, precious sunlight. Water can be used in many ways to relieve suffering. Draughts of clear, hot water, taken before eating (half a quart, more or less), will never do any harm, but will rather be productive of good. A cup of tea made from catnip herb will quiet the nerves. Hop tea will induce sleep. Hop poultices over the stomach will relieve pain. If the eyes are weak, if there is pain in the eyes, or inflammation, soft flannel clothes wet in hot water and salt, will bring relief quickly. When the head is congested, if the feet and limbs are put in a bath with a little mustard, relief will be obtained. There are many more simple remedies which will do much to restore healthful action to the body. All these simple preparations the Lord expects us to use for ourselves, but man's extremities are God's opportunities. If we neglect to do that which is within the reach of nearly every family, and ask the Lord to relieve pain, when we are too indolent to make use of these remedies within our power, it is simply presumption. The Lord expects us to work in order that we obtain food. He does not propose that we shall gather the harvest unless we break the sod, till the soil, and cultivate the produce. Then God sends the rain and the sunshine and the clouds to cause vegetation to flourish. God works and man cooperates with God. Then there is seed time and harvest. God has caused to grow out of the ground, herbs for the use of man, and if we understand the nature of those roots and herbs, and make a right use of them, there would not be a necessity of running for the doctor, so frequently, and people would be in much better health than they are today. I believe in calling upon the Great Physician when we have used the remedies I have mentioned. In regard to manner of labor, we certainly need to be wise as serpents and harmless as doves. We might be very zealous, but it might be an unwise zeal, and serve to hedge up our way. Then there is danger of being so circumscribed in our work as to do very little good. -"},{"refcode_short":"PC 29","refcode_long":"The Paulson Collection of Ellen G.

Such is the grace of God, such the love wherewith He hath loved us, even when we were dead in trespasses and sins, enemies in our minds by wicked works, loving divers lusts and pleasures, the slaves of debase appetites and passions, servants of sin and Satan.

One steadfast look to the Saviour uplifted upon the cross will do more to purify the mind and heart from every defilement than will all the scientific explanations by the ablest tongues. Before the cross the sinner sees his unlikeness of character to Christ, he sees the terrible consequences of transgression, he hates the sin that he has practiced, and he lays hold upon Jesus by living faith. He has judged his position of uncleanness in the light of the presence of God and the heavenly intelligence. He has measured it by the standard of the cross; he has weighed it in the balances of the Sanctuary. The purity of Christ has revealed to him his own impurity in its odious colors.

We then rode eight miles to our home in Granville, and as the horse climbed the hilly road, we ate our lunch with cheerfulness and gladness of heart. Thank God, the meeting-house is going up; it is small, as cheap as possible, but it will be a precious place, dedicated to the service of God. O, how carefully we considered the question of means. What a hunting there was to see if we could not find some hidden treasure which we could appropriate; how we prayed and studied and planned! Our family did what they could. I engaged to be responsible for five pounds, brethren Starr and Hickox united in giving five pounds stg., Willie gave two pounds, and some other members of the family gave one pound. Well, the amount was still insufficient to make a start. The little company in their poverty did all they possibly could, each giving one pound; one brother gave five pounds; yet the amount was so small; then I doubled my subscription, making it ten pounds, but I saw that discouragement was upon the minds of the brethren as to the possibility of reaching the sum required.

God requires no man to cast aside his reason, and yield to the control of blind credulity. But we are to search the Scriptures in the spirit of learners. In the meekness of Christ canvas every point of difference. Search for the truth as for hidden treasures. It will not do to ignore these questions of vital interest. Human assertions are as valueless as straw. Many will miss the path to heaven because they rest their faith upon men. They resist the message of mercy because some one in whom they have confidence is indifferent to it. But the soul is of too great value to rest its faith on man. No one but Christ can ransom the soul. We have the word of God, and this alone can we trust unwaveringly. Let brethren seek God together. Let them fall upon the Rock and be broken. “Ye are laborers together with God.” We must understand the obligations imposed upon us by this co-operation, or we shall never stand approved in the Judgment.

We are not to try and excel this one and excel that one, but let our own fruit, in words, proper words, right words, words that will bless someone - let these words be spoken. But the converting power of God needs to be in all our schools, and we want to act for Christ. We want to serve him. We want to glorify him. We want to honor him, who made it possible by coming into our world and giving himself, giving himself a sacrifice to make it possible for us to be saved. That is what we want to appreciate, and we want to work it out in our life. We do not want to be a careless people here. We want everyone of us to be in the path that leads heavenward. And you read in the precious Book that “if you will follow on to know the Lord ye shall know his going forth is prepared as the morning.” You know what that is. We need not give you any explanation at all. We want the saving grace of God. We do not want to try - and there is in every place, as it is presented to me, always all this striving to be first, for fear you shall not have the first honor and that you shall not have the glory of this and that and the other thing."},{"refcode_short":"PC 180.2","refcode_long":"The Paulson Collection of Ellen G.

Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked; I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eye salve that thou mayest see. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten; be zealous therefore, and repent.” There are many who are priding themselves upon their spiritual riches, their knowledge of the truth, and are living in guilty self-deception. When the members of the church humble themselves before God by zealous, not half-hearted, lifeless action, the Lord will receive them. But he declares, “I will come unto thee quickly and remove thy candlestick out of its place except thou repent.” How long shall this warning be resisted? How long shall it be slighted?"},{"refcode_short":"PC 341.2","refcode_long":"The Paulson Collection of Ellen G.

Now, those who have lived years in this same experience know not God nor Jesus Christ whom he hath sent; and should such go forth as representatives of Jesus Christ?

The worshippers of God are in need of transforming grace to subordinate the world to religion. In the place of making the temporal interest first, exhausting soul, body, and spirit to secure temporal advantages, Jesus points us to the heavenly treasure, and tells us not to lay up our treasure in earth which will perish, but to lay up for ourselves treasure in heaven which will not perish, for where our treasure is there will our heart be also. Jesus would have all that profess to believe in him deal in the currency of heaven, handling those things upon which God has stamped his image and superscription. These he presents before us of infinite value. We see the need of a deep and thorough work in our churches; but the Lord alone can by his Holy Spirit make the hearts that are as steel, soft and sympathetic, and true to the service of Christ.

The diet of animals generally used for food is vegetables and grains. Must the vegetables be animalized before we can eat them? Must they be incorporated into the system of an animal before we can digest them? Must we obtain our vegetable diet by eating the flesh of dead creatures? God provided fruit in its natural state for our first parents. He gave Adam charge of the garden to dress it and to care for it, saying, “To you it shall be for meat.” The plan was not for one animal to destroy another animal for food. After the fall, the eating of flesh was suffered in order to shorten the period of the existence of the long-lived race. It was allowed because of the hardness of the hearts of men. One of the great errors that many insist upon is, that muscular strength is dependent upon animal food. But the simple grains, fruits of the trees, and vegetables have all the nutritive properties necessary to make good blood.

The books registering the deeds of men revealed the dealings of those professing godliness in our institutions, showing that it was after the world's standard, and not in strict accordance with God's great standard of righteousness. That which bears a close relation to the question of dealing with others, especially with those connected with the work of God, was opened to me quite fully. The Spirit of Christ did not enter into and control the brethren's business arrangements. Their dealings were too much after the sharp policy plan, and not according to God's rule of right and justice.

God's cause cannot be advanced by any acts which are contrary to the Spirit and character of Christ. Men should show an unselfish interest, seeking to advance one another's interest; for the cause of God can afford to be fair. Even a single instance of sharp dealing is an offense to God; and that which is sown will be reaped again. A selfish manner of dealing will provoke the same spirit in others.

Let men receive a mold of character in the school of Christ; learning meekness and lowliness of heart from Jesus, and they will be less self-sufficient, less self-confident, and will not have too high an opinion of their own ability, but will be regarded by those in the office as Christian brethren, walking humbly with God, trying to serve in whatever capacity they can do the most good without trying to exalt themselves. This lesson has not been learned by some. Therefore, they have a new character to form, a new experience to gain, which shall fit them to come close to the hearts of their brethren, and to deal with those who have a part to act in the work. They will have to guard themselves closely, or they will be dictatorial and officious, ready to give orders, to speak of, and to take the oversight of, things of which they are ignorant, and will thus disgust the workers in the office. If they take hold in a humble way, trying to learn as much as they can, maintain the position of learner rather than a director, they will make themselves friends in the office. Every one that serves in the board meetings, needs to seek most earnestly the wisdom from above. The influence of the Spirit of Christ upon their hearts will then place a right mold upon the work. The transforming grace of Christ will be manifest in every board meeting, quelling tumultuous actions, and charming away the unhallowed effects of business, and checking the sharp critical, worldly policy which makes men overbearing and ready to accuse. There will have to be most earnest reformation in the characters of those who are now connected with our important institutions. Some of these men possess valuable talents, but they must fashion their lives after the divine character of Christ. Every one must remember that they have not yet “attained” - the work of character building is not yet finished. If they will improve every ray of light God has given, and walk in this light, they will learn lessons from Christ. By comparing their lives with Christ's character, they will be able to discern where they have failed to meet the requirements of God's holy law; and will seek to make themselves perfect in their sphere even as God is perfect in his sphere.

Judas had the same opportunities to learn as did the other disciples, but he was a hearer only, and not a doer. The result was manifested in the betrayal of His Lord. God has connected men with his instrumentalities, and he wants them to be learners; they must not feel self-sufficient, or self-important, but must ever realize that they are treading on holy ground. Angels of God are ready to minister unto them, and they must receive light and heavenly influences daily, or they are no more fit for the work than are unbelievers.

My brethren must remember that the cause of God includes more than the publishing house, and other institutions established at Battle Creek. No one understands better than Brother Smith the difficulties through which the Publishing Association was brought into existence, for he has been connected with it from its earliest years when it was oppressed by poverty, and self-denial had to be carried into our practical life. The table was hardly supplied with sufficient food to sustain our lives; there was economy in dressing and in wages paid. This was positively necessary in order that the paper might live. Those who passed through these experiences would be ready, under similar circumstances, to undergo the same privations again. It does not show very good grace for those who have had no part in raising the work up to its present prosperous condition, to press and urge, and even try to force the early workers to submit to terms which they can see no justice in. Brother Smith loves the cause of God. He loves the truth, and will invest his means to advance it wherever he sees that it is necessary.

A train of evils would grow out of such an arrangement that would be disastrous to the Association.

The Bible precepts must be carried out in every day life. They will be a lamp to your feet and a light to your path. The greatest of all deceptions is for a man to think that he can find a better guide through difficulties than is found in the word of God. It is the worst kind of policy to leave the Lord out of your councils and put your confidence in the wisdom of men. In your positions of trust you are, in a special sense, to be the light of the world, and in order that you may be clean channels of light you should feel an intense desire to place yourselves in connection with the God of light, of wisdom and knowledge. Important interests that relate to the prosperity and advancement of present truth are to be considered; and how can you be competent to arrive at right decisions, to give wise counsels, and to make proper plans unless you are connected with the source of all wisdom and righteousness? Your councils have been regarded in altogether too cheap a light, and common talk, and comments upon others’ doings have found a place in these important meetings. You should bear in mind that the all seeing eye of Jehovah is a witness in all your councils; he measures everyone of your decisions, and compares them with his holy law, the great moral standard of righteousness. Those holding the positions of counselors should be unselfish men, men of faith, men of prayer, men that will not dare to rely upon their own human wisdom, but will seek earnestly for light and intelligence as to what is the best manner of conducting their business. Joshua, the commander of Israel, searched the books diligently in which Moses had faithfully chronicled the directions given by God; his requirements, reproofs, and restrictions, lest he should move unadvisedly. Joshua was afraid to trust his own impulses, or his own wisdom. He regarded everything that came from Christ, who was enshrouded with a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night, as of sufficient importance to be sacredly cherished. He meditated day and night upon the words which had been spoken to Moses, the servant of God. Joshua desired to know and to do, God's will, and he was commanded by God to study and meditate upon all the directions which had been given: “For then, shalt thou make thy way prosperous, and thou shalt have success.” The secret of Joshua's victories was that, even amid his accumulated cares and responsibilities, he dared not trust to his own finite wisdom, but made God his counselor and guide."},{"refcode_short":"PC 377.1","refcode_long":"The Paulson Collection of Ellen G.

The lack of humility, the loss of faith and sterling integrity, should cause intense sorrow. If the soul is filled with earthly things; if the heart has not maintained close communion with God; there is no room for heavenly intelligence to work, and there is an earthliness in every project that is devised.

For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteousness, are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way when we were come forth out of Egypt; how he met thee by the way, and smote the hindermost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary: and he feared not God.” Notwithstanding that the children of Israel had often grieved the Lord by departing from his counsel, he still had a tender care for them. The Lord Jesus Christ saw their enemies taking advantage of their circumstances, to do them an injury; for that work was to bring suffering against the weary, who were journeying under God's leading. Hear the judgments which God pronounced: “Therefore it shall be, when the Lord thy God hath given rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget it.”"},{"refcode_short":"PC 415.1","refcode_long":"The Paulson Collection of Ellen G.

If the heathen received this denunciation from their course for overcoming the faint and weary, what will the Lord express toward those who have had light, great opportunities, and privileges, but have not manifested the Spirit of Christ toward their own brethren? The Lord sees all the dealings of brother with brother, which weaken faith, and which destroy their own confidence in themselves as men dealing with justice and equity. In the most positive language he expresses his displeasure at the iniquity practised in trade. He says, “Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?” The very wrong here mentioned may not have been committed in our institutions, but acts which these things represent have been, and are still being done. Page after page might be written in regard to these things. Whole conferences are becoming leavened with the same perverted principles. “For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.” The Lord will work to purify his church. I tell you in truth, the Lord is about to turn and overturn in the institutions called by his name. Just how soon this refining process will begin, I cannot say, but it will not be long deferred. He whose fan is in his hand will cleanse his temple of its moral defilement. He will thoroughly purge his floor. God has a controversy with all who practise the least injustice; for in so doing they reject the authority of God, and imperil their interest in the atonement, the redemption which Christ has undertaken for every son and daughter of Adam.

For while they are kept in positions of trust, their voice and influence sway many things in the wrong direction. When matters of the greatest importance have come up for decision, their judgment on the questions has depended on the state of mind they chanced to be in. The mind and heart are not under the influence of the Spirit of God. They are men of strong temperament, decided preferences, and much force of character, and their will and influence have decided matters under the control of another spirit than the Spirit of God. If these men had a sense of what they have been doing, of what they must meet in that great day, when all shall see as they are seen, and know as they are known, they would feel an anguish of heart, an agony of soul, that would be somewhat proportionate to the harm they have done the cause of God.
