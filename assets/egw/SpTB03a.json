Receive into our sanitariums only those who desire to conform to right principles, those who will accept the foods that we can conscientiously place before them. Should we allow patients to have intoxicating liquor in their rooms, or should we serve them with meat, we could not give them the help they should receive in coming to our sanitariums. We must let it be known that from principle we exclude such articles from our sanitariums and our hygienic restaurants.

They must not, for the sake of obtaining the influence of some one who is wealthy, become entangled in plans dishonoring to their profession of faith. They must not sell their souls for financial advantage. They must do nothing that will retard the work of God, and lower the standard of righteousness. We are God's servants, and we are to be workers together with Him, doing His work in His way, that all for whom we labor may see that our desire is to reach a higher standard of holiness. Those with whom we come in contact are to see that we not only talk of self-denial and sacrifice, but that we reveal it in our lives. Our example is to inspire those with whom we come in contact in our work, to become better acquainted with the things of God."},{"refcode_short":"SpTB03a 4.1","refcode_long":"Letters to Sanitarium Workers in Southern California, p. 4.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"If we are to go to the expense of building sanitariums in order that we may work for the salvation of the sick and afflicted, we must plan our work in such a way that those we desire to help will receive the help they need. We are to do all in our power for the healing of the body; but we are to make the healing of the soul of far greater importance.

And they are to be so conducted that a decided impression in favor of the truth will be made on the minds of those who come to them for treatment. The conduct of the workers, from the head manager to the worker occupying the humblest position, is to tell on the side of truth. The institution is to be pervaded by a spiritual atmosphere. We have a warning message to bear to the world, and our earnestness, our devotion to God's service, is to impress those who come to our sanitariums."},{"refcode_short":"SpTB03a 5.1","refcode_long":"Letters to Sanitarium Workers in Southern California, p. 5.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"As soon as possible, sanitariums are to be established in different places in Southern California.

Several small sanitariums are to be established in Southern California, for the benefit of the multitudes drawn there in the hope of finding health.

Recently much light has been given me in regard to the manner in which God desires us to conduct sanitarium work. We are to encourage patients to spend much of their time out-of-doors.

For years I have been given special light that we are not to establish large centers for our work in the cities. The turmoil and confusion that fills these cities, the conditions brought about by the labor unions and the strikes, would prove a great hindrance to our work. Men are seeking to bring those engaged in the different trades under certain unions. This is not God's plan, but the planning of a power that we should in no case acknowledge. God's Word is fulfilling; the wicked are binding themselves in bundles ready to be burned."},{"refcode_short":"SpTB03a 6.4","refcode_long":"Letters to Sanitarium Workers in Southern California, p. 6.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I have been instructed that the work in Southern California should have advantages that it has not yet enjoyed. I have been shown that in Southern California there are properties for sale on which buildings are already erected that could be utilized for our work, and that such properties will be offered to us at much less than their original cost. In these places, away from the din and confusion of the congested cities, we can establish sanitariums in which the sick can be cared for in the way in which God designs them to be. In our efforts to help the sick, we are to take them away from the cities, where they are continually annoyed by the noise of trains and street cars, and where there is little besides houses to see, to places where they can be surrounded by the scenes of nature, and where they can have the blessing of fresh air and sunshine."},{"refcode_short":"SpTB03a 7.1","refcode_long":"Letters to Sanitarium Workers in Southern California, p. 7.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"This subject was laid out before me in Australia. Light was given me that the cities would be filled with confusion, violence, and crime, and that these things would increase till the close of this earth's history. There is much to be said on this point. Instruction is to be given line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little. And our physicians and teachers should be quick to see the advantage of retired locations for our sanitariums and schools."},{"refcode_short":"SpTB03a 7.2","refcode_long":"Letters to Sanitarium Workers in Southern California, p. 7.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Properties such as those to which I have referred are being offered to us, and some of them we should purchase when it is plain that they are what we need, and when provision can be made for their acquisition without a burdensome debt. Where there are orchards on these places, so much the better; but on other properties, where the buildings are just what we need, trees can be set out."},{"refcode_short":"SpTB03a 7.3","refcode_long":"Letters to Sanitarium Workers in Southern California, p. 7.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The fact that in many cases, the owners of these properties are anxious to dispose of them, and are therefore willing to sell at a low price, is greatly in our favor. We must study economy in the outlay of means. At this stage of our work, we are not to erect large buildings in any of the cities. And we are not to follow extravagant and unduly large plans in our work in any place. We are to remember the cities which have been neglected, and which must now be worked. The people in these cities must have the light of truth. In our establishment of sanitariums, we are not to spend large sums of money in the erection of costly buildings; for there are many places to be worked. We are to be wise in securing advantages already provided that the Lord desires us to have. We are to be as wise as serpents and as harmless as doves in our efforts to secure country properties at a low figure, and from these outpost centers we are to work the cities."},{"refcode_short":"SpTB03a 8.1","refcode_long":"Letters to Sanitarium Workers in Southern California, p. 8.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The work in Southern California is to advance more rapidly than it has advanced in the past.

The Lord designs that much more shall be done in this city than has been done there. But I can not speak freely about this at present, for fear that men will take advantage of what I say, and will endeavor, by my words, to vindicate wrong plans. Some of the brethren in Los Angeles have at times lacked spiritual discernment. They have not always been able to see what could be done by proper effort on their part. A large work has been done in some lines, but the methods followed have not been such as to bring glory to God in the saving of souls."},{"refcode_short":"SpTB03a 8.3","refcode_long":"Letters to Sanitarium Workers in Southern California, p. 8.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I have been instructed that the greatest work that we can do in this life is to prepare for the future immortal life and help others to prepare for it.

On the night of October 10, 1901, I was unable to sleep after half past eleven at night. Many things regarding the sanitarium work were presented to me in figures and symbols. I was shown sanitariums near Los Angeles in running order. At one place I saw sanitarium work being carried on in a beautiful building. On the grounds surrounding the building there were many fruit trees.

I seemed to be living there myself, and I could not help speaking of the change that took place in these countenances. Where once was written despair, we could now read hope and joy.

The work can be carried forward only by patience and harmony of action. It has been a lack of harmony, a lack of determination on the part of the workers to lift with one purpose in view, that has delayed the establishment of a sanitarium in Southern California. There has been so much variance that means which should have been invested in a sanitarium has been turned into other channels."},{"refcode_short":"SpTB03a 15.2","refcode_long":"Letters to Sanitarium Workers in Southern California, p. 15.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The idea that a sanitarium should not be established unless it could be started free from debt, has put the brake upon the wheels of progress. In building meeting-houses, I have had to borrow money, in order that something might be done at once. I have been obliged to do this, in order to fulfil the directions of God. For the past twenty years I have been borrowing money and paying interest on it, to establish schools and sanitariums and to build meeting-houses. The institutions thus established and the churches built have been the means of winning many to the truth. Thus the tithe has been increased, and workers have been added to the Lord's forces."},{"refcode_short":"SpTB03a 15.3","refcode_long":"Letters to Sanitarium Workers in Southern California, p. 15.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Will my brethren consider this, and work in accordance with the light God has given us?
