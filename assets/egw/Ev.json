Some phases of evangelism have been delineated in nearly all the Ellen G. White books. Through the years, in the Review and Herald, Signs of the Times, and other journals, articles from the Lord's messenger have given impetus to a growing evangelistic ministry. Individual evangelists were also, from time to time, favored in receiving instruction and warning regarding methods that should characterize their labor. Occasionally groups of evangelists and denominational administrators were addressed by Mrs. White, and these addresses often embodied much helpful counsel."},{"refcode_short":"Ev 5.3","refcode_long":"Evangelism, p. 5.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"But these periodical articles, special testimonies, personal counsels, and addresses are not generally available today.

In the effort to place before the reader all that contributed to the subject, without presenting undue repetition, only paragraphs or groups of paragraphs were selected.

Great care has been exercised, however, to present statements of sufficient length to give the correct setting for the counsel."},{"refcode_short":"Ev 6.3","refcode_long":"Evangelism, p. 6.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"An endeavor has been made to make each section a complete treatment of the subject presented.

And although in some instances it may not be possible to employ in minute detail methods advocated in earlier years, yet the basic principles enunciated or illustrated in these earlier counsels will today be a guide to safe and fruitful methods.

In the seventies Seventh-day Adventist camp meetings attracted very large non-Adventist week-end attendance, with congregations ranging from half church members and half non-Adventists to the unusual ratio of fifteen non-Adventists to one church member. In the nineties very successful evangelistic camp meetings held in the suburbs of large cities lasted from two weeks to a month. Such meetings were of large soul-winning potentiality.

Likewise, medical evangelism, treated so fully and well in Ministry of Healing, Medical Ministry, and Counsels on Health, is not dwelt upon except as it relates to the public presentation of the message.

These two men were not alike either in their disposition or in their manner of labor. Peter was prompt and zealous in action, bold and uncompromising, and would often wound; John was ever calm, and considerate of others’ feelings, and would come after to bind up and encourage.

To dress plainly, and abstain from display of jewelry and ornaments of every kind is in keeping with our faith. Are we of the number who see the folly of worldlings in indulging in extravagance of dress as well as in love of amusements? If so, we should be of that class who shun everything that gives sanction to this spirit which takes possession of the minds and hearts of those who live for this world only, and who have no thought or care for the next.—Testimonies For The Church 3:366 (1875)."},{"refcode_short":"Ev 270.1","refcode_long":"Evangelism, p. 270.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Conformity to Christ or the World—A sister who had spent some weeks at one of our institutions in _____, said that she felt much disappointed in what she saw and heard there....

When she saw among those who profess the faith such a wide departure from Bible simplicity, she felt bewildered. Had they not the same Bible which she had been studying, and to which she had endeavored to conform her life? Had her past experience been mere fanaticism?

There is no need to make the dress question the main point of your religion. There is something richer to speak of.
