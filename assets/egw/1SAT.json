Yet, under the blessing of God, this frail teenager developed into a remarkably gifted and popular pulpiteer. It is estimated that during the seventy years of her prophetic ministry (1844-1915) she delivered at least 10,000 sermons and public addresses, on three continents. She spoke at Sabbath morning church services, camp meetings, ministerial councils, revivals, General Conference sessions, college chapel exercises, temperance rallies, conventions, church dedications, and wherever else there was need for public labor."},{"refcode_short":"1SAT i.2","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 1, p. i.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The range of Ellen White's interests, both in writing and in speaking, was as wide as human experience. The 465 Ellen White discourses analyzed by Horace J. Shaw in his doctoral dissertation (The Speaking of Ellen White, Michigan State University, 1959) reveal that she addressed topics such as health and temperance; issues affecting the ministerial, medical, educational, and publishing work of the church; and, especially, subjects encouraging Christian faith and living. In her public messages, as in her articles and books, Ellen White uplifted Jesus Christ with unparalleled conviction and skill. Christ was the center of her life and the focus of her preaching."},{"refcode_short":"1SAT i.3","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 1, p. i.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"All the messages reproduced in this volume were delivered in public and stenographically reported, or were prepared with that purpose in view. Many of Ellen White's sermons may be found in the Review and Herald and Signs of the Times, but nearly all of those included in this series have been drawn from previously unpublished manuscripts, as they appear in our files.

In the act they were, they thought, taking the load when they were not stirring it.

These men and women had a machine of their own to work, but the machine of each was united with a larger machine. Every one must keep his or her hand employed on his or her own machine, and then the larger machinery worked beautifully and every revolution of the great wheel was exact and harmonious.

Those that had been the most to blame said, “Do not be so severe. We thought we were carrying out your express directions in doing as we have done.

No. If one should steal the money out of my purse, and then come, and confessing the crime, ask me to forgive him, and I shall pardon him, and then he goes and does the same thing again, does not this show that there is no change in his life? So it is with those who have asked God to forgive them and then gone right on transgressing His law. They say, “Lord, Lord,” but He says, “Depart from Me.” While I freely pardoned you, you were doing the same thing again. Your very course was leading others in the way of the transgressor.

He refused to take any course that would offend His God. He kept the Lord continually before Him. He would pray, “Teach me Thy way, that I may not err. What is thy pleasure concerning me? What shall I do to honor Thee, my God?” Thus he was constantly shaping his way and course in accordance with God's commandments, and he had perfect confidence and trust in his heavenly Father, that He would help him.

The religion of Jesus Christ has a refining influence upon men and women. When the truth of God finds access to the heart, it commences its refining process upon the character. Men who are coarse and rough become humble, teachable, learning, ever learning, in the school of Christ. The mighty cleaver of truth has taken them out of the world. Then there is the work to be done for them to fit them for God's temple. They are hewed and squared and chiseled and fitted for the mansions in heaven. Those who are naturally full of self-esteem become meek and lowly; they have a change in character. In the beginning, God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.” But sin has almost obliterated the moral image of God in man. Jesus came down to our world that He might give man a living example, that he might know how to live and how to keep the way of the Lord. He was the image of the Father. His beautiful and spotless character is before man as an example for him to imitate. We must study the copy and follow Jesus Christ, then we shall bring His loveliness and beauty into our character.

And then Christ opened to them the Scriptures, commencing at Moses and the prophets.

Only those who have kept the truth—kept it in practice—can enter through the gates into the city of God."},{"refcode_short":"1SAT 403.2","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 1, p. 403.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The words of Christ are spoken for His people in all ages—for us upon whom the ends of the world are come. The test that will come to us will be upon the commandments of God. Only as we become partakers of the divine nature shall we learn to overcome. I pray that none in this congregation may lightly regard this great privilege, but that each may be a living branch of the true vine, bearing fruit to the glory of God."},{"refcode_short":"1SAT 403.3","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 1, p. 403.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In the life of Christ a perfect pattern has been given to every child of humanity. From infancy to manhood the life of Christ was perfect, teaching us that in everything we should seek perfection. To His work at His father's bench He brought the same principle. Some would laugh at Him for the pains He would take, but He would not be turned from His purpose to bring out of that which was imperfect something that would stand the test of proving."},{"refcode_short":"1SAT 404.1","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 1, p. 404.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"And in His spiritual as in His temporal life Christ was perfect. Did He not have temptations? We know that He did. We know that temptation came to Him in every form. He knew what trial was. He spent whole nights in prayer to His Father. He wrestled with the powers of darkness until He overcame. And how fully the glory of the Father was revealed through Him!"},{"refcode_short":"1SAT 404.2","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 1, p. 404.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Should we not honor the One who gave His Son to a life of trial and reproach for us? In giving His Son to a life of suffering God would teach us that because we suffer we have no reason to feel that we are not children of God, and thus lose faith in Him. When we are in trouble, let us think of this. If we would have more faith, we would see more of the glory of God than we do."},{"refcode_short":"1SAT 404.3","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 1, p. 404.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I think of the children in our families. Are we teaching them to live so that the gates of the city of God will be opened to them? Let fathers and mothers feel the solemn obligation resting upon them to teach their children the way of the Lord in kindness and tenderness and love. The mother should be the first teacher of her child. Parents, be kind and gentle with your children, and they will learn gentleness. Let us demonstrate in our homes that we are Christians. I value as worthless that profession that is not carried out in the home life in kindness and forbearance and love. Let us seek to form characters after the divine similitude. Let us maintain a living connection with heaven."}]
