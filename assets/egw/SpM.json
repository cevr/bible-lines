This would not be unlikely, for those who are suffering will do anything in their power to obtain relief and to regain their health. Of these twenty, few have regarded the light on the subject of purity and health reform. They have neglected to practice right principles in eating and drinking, and in taking care of their bodies: and those who are married have formed gross habits, and indulged in unholy practices, while those who are unmarried have been reckless of life and health. In clear rays the light has shone upon them; but they have not had respect to the light, nor have they walked circumspectly; yet they solicit the prayers of God's people, and call for the elders of the church.

This is another reason why we should say after our earnest petition, “Nevertheless, not my will, but Thine, O Lord, be done.” Such a petition will never be registered in heaven as a faithless prayer. The Apostle was bidden to write: “Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth; Yea saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.” From this we can see that every one is not to be judged as unworthy of eternal life. If Jesus, the world's Redeemer, prayed, “O My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me,” and then added, “Nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt,” how very appropriate is it for poor, finite mortals to make surrender to the wisdom and will of God."},{"refcode_short":"SpM 7.1","refcode_long":"Spalding and Magan Collection, p. 7.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In praying for the sick, we are to pray that if it be God's will, they may be raised up, but if not, that He will give them His grace to comfort, His presence to sustain them in their suffering. Many who should set their house in order, neglect to do it when they have hope that they will be raised to health in answer to prayer. Buoyed up by a false hope, they do not feel the need of saying words of exhortation to their children, parents, or friends, and it is a great misfortune. Accepting the assurance that they should be healed when prayed for, they dare not make a reference as to how their property should be disposed of, how their family is to be cared for, or express any wish concerning their matters of which they would speak if they thought they should be removed by death. In this way disasters are brought upon the family and friends. For many things are left unmentioned, because they fear expressions on these points would be a denial of their faith that should be understood. Believing that they will be raised to health by prayer, they fail to make use of hygienic measures that are in their power to use, fearing that it would be a denial of their faith.

Now I want you to consider, teachers, where you stand, and deal with yourselves, and pronounce judgment against yourselves; for you have not only infringed the rules, you have been so sharp, so severe upon students; but more than this, there is a controversy between you and God.

The Lord God of Israel has wrought in your midst again and again. You have had great evidences of the stately steppings of the Most High.

Will you consider Jeremiah 17:5-10; 18:12-15: for you are most surely coming under the rebuke of God. Light has been shining in clear and steady rays upon you. What has this light done for you?

The various little dishes concocted for desserts are injurious instead of helpful and healthful, and from the light given me there should be a decided change in the preparation of food. There should be a skillful, thorough cook, that will give ample supplies to the hungry students of substantial dishes. The education in this line of table supplies is not correct or healthful and satisfying, and there is a decided reform essential. These students are God's inheritance, and the most sound and healthful principles are to be brought into the boarding school in regard to diet. The dishes of soft foods, the soups and liquid foods, or the free use of meat, are not the best to give healthful muscles, sound digestive organs, or clean brains. Oh, how slow we are to learn! And of all institutions in our world the school is the most important. Here the diet question is to be studied; no one person's appetite, or tastes, or fancy, or notion is to be followed, but there is need of great reform: for life-long injury will surely be the result of the present manner of cooking. Of all the positions of importance in that college is the one who is employed to direct the dishes to be prepared to place before the hungry students; for if this be neglected, the mind will not be prepared to do its work, because the stomach has been treated unwisely and can not do its work properly. Strong minds are needed. The human intellect must gain expansion and vigor and acuteness and activity. It must be taxed to do hard work, or it will become weak and inefficient. The brain power is required to think most earnestly: it must be put to the stretch to solve hard problems and master them, else the mind decreases in power and aptitude to think. The mind must invent work, and wrestle, in order to give hardness and vigor to the intellect; and, if the physical organs are not kept in the most healthful condition by substantial, nourishing food, the brain does not receive its portion of nutrition to work. Daniel understood this, and he brought himself to a plain, simple, nutritious diet, and refused the luxuries of the king's table. The desserts which take so much time to prepare are, many of them, detrimental to health. Solid foods requiring mastication will be far better than mush or liquid foods. I dwell upon this as essential. I send my warning to the College at Battle Creek, to go from there to all our institutions of learning. Study up on these subjects, and let the students obtain a proper education in the preparation of wholesome, appetizing, solid foods that nourish the system.

Memory suffers, laid on the altar of base, hurtful practices, “He that soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting.” When teachers and learners shall consecrate soul, body, and spirit to God, purify their thought by obedience to the laws of God, they will continually receive a new endowment of physical and mental power. Then will there be heart yearnings after God, and earnest prayer for clear perceptions to discern. The office and work of the Holy Spirit is not for them to use it, as many suppose, but for the Holy Spirit to use them, molding fashioning, and sanctifying every power. The giving of the faculties to lustful practices disorders the brain and nerve power, and though professing religion they are not and never will be agents whom God can use; for He despises the practices of impurity in lessening physical vigor and mental capabilities, so that everything like mental taxation will after a short time become irksome.

When there is a determined purpose born in your heart to overcome, you will have a disposition to overcome, and will cultivate those traits of character that are desirable, and will engage in conflict with steady, persevering effort. You will exercise a ceaseless watchfulness over defects of character, and will cultivate right practices in little things. The difficulty of overcoming will be lessened in proportion as the heart is sanctified by the grace of Christ. Earnest, persevering effort will place you on the vantage-ground of victory: for he who strives to overcome, in and through the grace of Christ, will have divine enlightenment, and will understand how great truths can be brought into little things, and religion can be carried in the little, as well as in the large concerns of life."},{"refcode_short":"SpM 80","refcode_long":"Spalding and Magan Collection, p. 80 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Hearing and Doing"},{"refcode_short":"SpM 80.1","refcode_long":"Spalding and Magan Collection, p. 80.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"By eating to excess the stomach is made to do double work, and the mind is affected and unfit to take in and comprehend eternal realities.

A meat diet changes the disposition, and strengthens animalism. We are composed of what we eat, and eating much flesh will diminish intellectual activity.

It is not toil in trades nor in cultivation of the soil, that degrades any man; it is not hard taxing labor that weakens the brain power, and creates sickness and disease; it is the little use made of the living machinery that enfeebles and causes disease and premature death. Disease of the organs that God has given to the living human agent is the cause of disease and feebleness of all powers, the intellect included. Adam was created in innocence, yet God gave him employment, to tend the garden. This did not degrade him. Here was his book of study—God in nature. He was to study God and obey Him. Paul had to work laboring with his hands, and felt no dishonor in it. All who would resist temptations that assail them from without and within must make sure that they are on the Lord's side, that His truth is in their hearts; that it keep a sentinel watch in their souls, ready to sound an alarm and summon them to action warring against evil.

The right use of one's self is the most valuable lesson that can be learned.

Their own hereditary and cultivated traits of character are indulged as precious qualifications, when they are death-leading in their influence over other minds. In plain, simple words, they walk in the sparks of their own kindling. They have a religion subject to, and controlled by, circumstances.

They need to learn in the day's work that on such a day they were destitute of the abiding presence of Christ, and that they should have been corrected and punished in place of the children for their perversity, for they merely caught the spirit of the teacher—the Satanic spirit surrounding their own souls works upon the children, and the children reflect back these influences."},{"refcode_short":"SpM 108.1","refcode_long":"Spalding and Magan Collection, p. 108.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Let every teacher who accepts the responsibility to educate the children and youth examine himself, and study critically from cause to effect.

The reason that many urge for desiring to adopt a child - the longing for something on which to center our affections - reveals the fact that the heart is not centered upon Christ: it is not absorbed in his work. When I have heard a wife mourning that her husband did not show her all the affection that she thought he should, I have sent a silent petition to God, that this soul might be refreshed with the Word. From the light that God has given me, I knew that she needed to drink the deep, cool waters of Lebanon, instead of the turbid streams of the valley. When women will feed upon the Water of Life, they will have far less sentimentalism, and far greater spirituality. They will purify their souls by obeying the truth. If a woman's life is connected with one whom God has chosen, to be a laborer together with God, let her consider that she can make his heart tired, and his soul sad, by her unconsecrated course of action. If self clamors for attention, and unless great devotion is shown her, she becomes unhappy, and she may greatly hinder him in his work. She needs to learn of Christ, who lived not to please himself.

The question for each to settle is, in doing this, shall I be merely gratifying my own wishes, or is it a duty the Lord has appointed me? Is this His way, or the way of my own choosing?

These women give their whole time, and are told that they receive nothing for their labors because their husbands receive their wages. I tell them to go forward and all such decisions shall be reversed. The Word says, “The laborer is worthy of his hire.” When any such decision as this is made, I will in the name of the Lord, protest. I will feel it in my duty to create a fund from my tithe money, to pay these women who are accomplishing just as essential work as the ministers are doing, and this tithe I will reserve for work in the same line as that of the ministers, hunting for souls, fishing for souls. I know that the faithful women should be paid wages proportionate to the pay received by ministers. They carry the burden of souls, and should not be treated unjustly. These sisters are giving their time to educating those newly come to the faith, and hire their own work done, and pay those who work for them. All these things must be adjusted and set in order, and justice be done to all. Proof-readers in the office receive their wages, two dollars and a half and three dollars a week. This I have had to pay, and others have to pay. But ministers’ wives, who carry a tremendous responsibility, devoting their entire time, have nothing for their labor. This will give you an idea of how matters are in this conference. There are seventy-five souls organized into a church, who are paying their tithe into the conference, and as a saving plan it has been deemed essential to let these poor souls labor for nothing! But this does not trouble me, for I will not allow it to go thus. In regard to the school's running in debt. The tuition has been altogether too low in America. Can not those who conduct the schools in America understand that this is the only way out? Why do they keep the price so low? An increase in price of educational advantages would stop that increasing debt. The students are to be fed, and they need good, nourishing food. They should not be stinted in the wholesome fruit and vegetarian diet; but cut off everything like the desserts. Let abundance of fruit be eaten with the meals, but custards and pastries are of no manner of use—all unnecessary. Now when the wiseheads*The original publication had the spelling “wise heads.” officiating in our schools study to run the school upon a sum wholly insufficient, year after year, they are engaged in a work that will bring debts; it can not be prevented. They have begun this policy in Cooranbong, but the very same results will follow. There is no justice, or requirement of God, for them to make such loose calculations. They make it necessary to practice the closest economy, and it is not always wise to bring down the diet as a means of avoiding debt. Economy must be practiced in every line to keep afloat, and not be drowned with debts: but there is to be an increase in the sum paid for tuition. This was presented to me while in Europe, and has been presented since to you and our schools; and the problem, “How shall our schools keep out of debt?” will always remain a problem until there are wiser calculations. Charge higher rates for students’ educational advantages, and then let persons have the management in cooking who know how to save and economize. Let the best talent be secured, even if good, reasonable wages have to be paid. The binding about the edges is essential. When these precautions are attended to, you will not have increasing debts in your schools. Let the teachers be health reformers; let them teach the Bible as the foundation study; let them practice the Word themselves. Let infidel books be laid aside, and the Word of God find its place in every school. Some will say, “We shall have fewer students.” This may be; but those that you do have will appreciate their time, and see the necessity of diligent work to qualify them for the positions they fill. If the Lord is kept ever before the students as the one to whom they should look for counsel, like Daniel, they will receive of him knowledge and wisdom. All will then become channels of light. Lay the matter before the students themselves. Inquire who of them will practice self-denial and make sacrifice to cancel the debt already incurred. With some students only the willing mind is needed. God help the managers of our schools never to allow the outgoes to exceed the incomes, if the school has to be closed. There has not been the talent that is needed in the management of our schools financially. These things God will require of the managers. Every needless, expensive habit is to be laid aside, every unnecessary indulgence cut away. When the principles so manifestly indicated by the Word of God to all schools are taken hold of as earnestly as they should be, the debts will not accumulate."},{"refcode_short":"SpM 118.1","refcode_long":"Spalding and Magan Collection, p. 118.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Whatever may be the amount of means coming in, strictest economy is to be studied.

Let me speak a word to you in the name of the Lord. When there is a proper course taken, in cases where students seem so easily led astray, there will be found no necessity for suspension or expulsion. There is a right way, and the Spirit of the Lord must move the human agent or else there will be grave mistakes made. It is the nicest work that was ever entered upon by the human agent, the dealing with human minds. Teachers are to consider that they are not dealing with angels, but with human beings who have like passions as they themselves have. Characters are not formed in one mold. Every phase of character is received by (different) children as an inheritance. The defects and the virtues in traits of character are thus revealed. Let every instructor take this into consideration. Hereditary and cultivated deformity of human character, as also beauty of character, will have to be met, and much grace cultivated in the instructor as to know how to deal with the erring for their present and eternal good. Impulse, impatience, pride, selfishness, and esteem, if cherished will do a great amount of evil which may thrust the soul upon Satan's battle-ground without the wisdom to navigate his bark, but he will be in danger of being tossed about at the sport of Satan's temptations until shipwrecked."},{"refcode_short":"SpM 144.1","refcode_long":"Spalding and Magan Collection, p. 144.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Every teacher has his own particular traits of character to watch, lest Satan should use him as his agent to destroy souls, by his own unconsecrated traits of character.

I must state to you that I have been shown that the best methods have not always been practiced in dealing with the errors and mistakes of students, and the result has been that souls have been imperilled and some have been lost. Evil tempers in the teachers, unwise movements, self-dignity, all have done a bad work. There is no form of vice, worldliness or drunkenness, that will do a more baleful work upon the character, imbittering the soul, and setting in train evils that overbear good, than human passions not under the control of the Spirit of God. Anger, getting touched, stirred up, will never pay. How many prodigals are kept out of the kingdom of God by the unlovely character of those who claim to be Christians. Jealousy, envy, pride, and uncharitable feelings, self-righteousness easily provoked, thinking evil, harshness, coldness, lack of sympathy, these are the attributes of Satan.

Respect shown to the struggling human soul is the sure means through Christ Jesus of the restoration of the self-respect the man has lost. Our advancing ideas of what he may become is a help we can not ourselves fully appreciate. We have need of the rich grace of God every hour, then we will have a rich, practical experience, for God is love. He that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God. Give love to them that need it most. The most unfortunate, those who have the most disagreeable temperaments, need our love, our tenderness, our compassion. Those who try our patience need most love. We pass through the world only once; any good thing we can do, we should do most earnestly, untiringly, with the same spirit as is stated of Christ in his work. He will not fail nor be discouraged. The rough, stubborn, sullen dispositions are the ones who need help the most. How can they be helped? Only by that love practiced in dealing with them which Christ revealed to fallen men. Treat them, you say, as they deserve? What if Christ had treated us thus? He, the undeserving, was treated as we deserve. Still we are treated by Christ with grace and love as we did not deserve, but as he deserved. Treat some characters as you think they richly deserve, and you will cut off from them the last thread of hope, spoil your influence, and ruin the soul. Will it pay? No, I say no, a hundred times no.

The student enters into, or falls into, temptation, and he is to be disciplined for his wrong. He feels keenly that his record is marred, and he disappoints those who have trusted him to develop a character under the influence of his training in his scholastic life which would pay all that has been invested in his behalf. But he is suspended for his foolish course of action. What will he do? Courage is at the lowest ebb, courage and even manliness are not cherished. He is an expense, and precious time is lost.

Christ's constant, forgiving love is binding up our souls’ interest with himself. O the mightiness of the love of Jesus overwhelms me as I consider it. The yoke of Christ is easy, and his burden is light. When we enter more entirely into the love of Jesus by practice, we shall see far different results in our own advancement as Christians, and in the molding of the characters of those brought into relationship with us. The most difficult business for individuals is the giving up of that which one thinks is his right. Love seeketh not her own. Heaven-born love strikes deeper then the surface. Love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up. Fortified with the grace of Christ, love doth not behave itself unseemly. He that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God. God is love.

I am deeply grieved in my heart, for serious results in unwise dealings have followed, more serious then many are willing to admit to their own conscience or to God. Self is so large in many, ever striving for the mastery. There are those who profess to be followers of Jesus Christ who have never died to self. They have never fallen on the Rock and been broken, Until this shall be, they will live unto self, and if they die as they are, it is forever too late for their wrongs to be righted. I love their souls. Jesus loves their souls, and he will do a good work for them, if they will humble themselves under his mighty hand, repent and be converted, surrender every day to God.

The high expectations were without proper results. The influence which began to work at the Conference was genuine, but the enemy interposed himself and spoiled the work by the deception he had prepared. The faith of many was dead, being alone. There was a large work to be done in cleansing the temple and the court thereof, but this work was not done. The life and power of God can not be manifested until there is seen that faith which works by love and sanctifies the soul. As far as the work went, it was done with earnestness, fervor, and true zeal. And so far God's blessing was given. But in the case of a large number, especially those in responsible positions in our institutions, the work of the Spirit was quenched by a deception of the enemy.

The Angel of God could have told Cornelius all about this message, but no, God's church must connect together, and the law that God imparted to Peter was to be imparted to Cornelius and all his family.

Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on Me through their word: that they all may be one; as thou, Father, are in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one: and that the world may know that thou has sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me. Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me; for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee, but I have known thee, and these have known that thou has sent me.

Our brethren left Battle Creek, and established Emmanuel Missionary College at Berrien Springs. They secured a beautiful tract of land in the country, and began small. There they have labored untiringly for the upbuilding of an educational institution that would be an honor to God and his cause. They have striven to get things in order, so that they could receive and properly care for the students who came. Faithfully have they endeavored to train the youth to be laborers together with God, and to depend upon Him for wisdom and guidance.

Those who were more directly responsible should labor to relieve their brethren at Berrien Springs of this burden. They should place themselves in the position of these pioneers who were under constant pressure to pay obligations they had not incurred,—pioneers who had by faith left Battle Creek, and who now are building up a school that God can approve. Too long the burden has rested on our brethren at Berrien Springs. They have kept their gracious intentions in view, devoting themselves to the task of clearing the old College property from debt.

It was suggested that those who had no land to use might give of their earnings. Those who kept chickens could contribute from the profits received from this source.

They need to learn how to pray and work for souls. The truth for these last days is to be proclaimed by purified human lips. When the live coal from the altar shall touch the lips of the believers, and they have been refined and purified by the Holy Spirit of God, then God can entrust them with his solemn message, and use them to glorify his name.

There is just one thing the Lord calls for, and that is, for every man, minister, or physician, or lay member, to confess his own sins. Each one will have a hard battle to fight with his own perverse self. Those who have stood directly in the way of the people, having a clear realization of their perilous condition, will have an account to settle with God. Those who have helped souls to feel at liberty to specify what is of God in the Testimonies, and what are the uninspired words of Sister White, will find that they were helping the devil in his work of deception.
