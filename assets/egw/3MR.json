These will show by their conversation that they have been communing with God, and that they have been receiving of the lessons Christ has taught to all, who would teach them meekness and lowliness of heart. But with most exalted views of Jesus, filled with His love, the words of wisdom will flow forth from the soul in words that will stir their hearts. His works are made manifest, not by pompous words of self-praise, but in the very opposite, in meekness of wisdom.

Although you profess to believe the truth, your judgment may assent to the truth, but if you have not the truth as it is in Jesus, you can present it only in your way, with your manner; and your very words and appearance show that you have not brought the truth into your life, and woven it into your character, but tied the truth onto the tree that bears thorn-berries. “This wisdom descendeth not from above....

Will the Lord give wisdom to His servants is my most earnest prayer. The Lord has abundant facilities in men and means; but the means is concentrated in building many institutions in certain localities in America. Building is added to building, house to house, and land to land; but the Lord does not favor this state of things.

The publishing interest should not have been removed from South Hampton to Grimsby; but should have remained in that important place, where greater character would have been given to the work until it could have been removed to London. That large city needs one hundred workers, and then the workers would scarcely be in touch one with another, if their fields were located in different parts. Our brethren in America must have the matter kept before them that men and means are needed for Europe, and for regions beyond. Our brethren in this country need the baptism of the Holy Spirit of God such as the disciples had on the day of Pentecost, in order that they may have an eye single to discern not only the things that are nigh, but fields that are afar off.

London has received too little attention. That which has been done by Elder Jones (the Seventh Day Baptist) in advocating the Sabbath of the fourth commandment has amounted to very little, and as long as he works in the lines in which he is now working, his work will amount to still less. The truth, the present truth, the truth for this time, is what is needed in London. We should enter the great cities with the message of God's truth; but without means or workers, we have a most discouraging outlook for work of this kind.

False reports, false representations of character, calumny, and every species of reproach, will be originated by the great deceiver to throw discredit upon the word of God and those who advocate it. But what voice shall say, Quit the field; it costs too much in time, and calls for too great an outlay of means, and is a hard and unprofitable field? Oh, never let this voice call you away from the work. Among the American brethren we see that which pains our hearts. Self-indulgence abounds in the church, and the world finds large patronage from its members, because self-denial is not practiced. Money is expended for unnecessary things, and we know that this means the limiting of donations which should be applied to the great enterprise of building up the kingdom of Christ in our world. As the world advances and converts the church to its customs, and to its fashions, and leads the professed follower of Christ to indulge in its gratifications, the treasury of God is robbed in the withholding of tithes and offerings that should be given that there may be “meat in mine house.” The indolence that is seen in the churches and among those who claim to believe the truth, brings its curse of results, which are represented in the parable of the slothful servant who buried his talent in the earth, and misrepresented his Lord who had loaned him the talent for wise improvement.

All who are attracted to nature may behold in it the God that created nature.

This knowledge, so far from giving elevated conceptions of God, so far from elevating the mind, the soul, the heart, and bringing the whole being into conformity to the will of God, will make men idolaters. Professing to be wise men, they become fools. Those who think they can obtain a knowledge of God aside from the Representative whom the word declares is “the express image of His person,” will need to become fools in their own estimation before they can be wise. Christ came as a personal Saviour. It is impossible to gain a perfect knowledge of God from nature, for nature itself is imperfect. A curse and blight is upon it. Yet the things of nature, marred as they are by the blight of sin, inculcate truths regarding the skillful Master Artist. One omnipotent in power, great in goodness, in mercy, and love, has created the earth, and even in its blighted state much that is beautiful remains.

It is the custom for all who are entertained to go to this table and help themselves, always cutting the bread and butter first at this large table. There are several smaller tables. If you call for food and specify the articles you want they are brought to you, and when anything on the large table is desired the guests arise, walk to the table and help themselves, and take it to the small table, but at the large general table you remain standing to cut bread and butter. It looked so odd to see men, one after another, come in, go to the long table, eat their bread and butter—walking about talking and eating—then sit at the small tables for a special dish; but eat and walk and talk from the long table until the dish they called for is brought in, and they take it to the small table and eat it, but always first eat the “butter goose”—which is bread and butter—at the large table.

Science, as revealed in Holy Writ, flashes light upon many hidden things in God's Word. The science of the Bible is pure, undefiled religion; it is the science of true godliness. And obedience to God, in all schemes of human benevolence—practical activity—is the science of salvation. The gospel is “the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.”—Manuscript 24, 1891, 19. (Diary, January 1-30, 1891.)"},{"refcode_short":"3MR 434.5","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 3 [Nos. 162-209], p. 434.5 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I will write some things which on several occasions the Lord has made known to me. Several years ago a decided reformation was called for in Healdsburg among those who claimed to be Christians. Reproofs from the Lord were given and confessions were made; but there was not a decided reform. Because former customs and practices were not forsaken, they were a constant temptation. The work done was not thorough. Souls were not cleansed from all spiritual defilement. Many failed to keep the vows they had made.—Letter 22, 1901, p. 1. (To “My Brethren and Sisters in California,” February 3, 1901.)"}]
