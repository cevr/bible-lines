The minister who labors should be sustained. But notwithstanding this, those who are officiating in this work see that there is not money in the treasury to pay the minister. The tithe money must be kept sacred. There are ministers who receive nothing for their labors; for there was no money to pay them.

This principle needs to be often brought before the men who are lax in their duty to God, and who are negligent and careless in bringing in their tithes, gifts, and offerings to God. “Will a man rob me?” “Wherein have we robbed thee?”, is the question asked by the unfaithful stewards. The answer comes plain and positive, “In tithes and offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse, for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.” Please read this whole chapter and see if words could be spoken that would be more plain and positive than these."},{"refcode_short":"PH166 19","refcode_long":"Special on Tithing, p. 19 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"No Excuse"},{"refcode_short":"PH166 19.1","refcode_long":"Special on Tithing, p. 19.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"They are so positive that no one who desires to understand his whole duty to God needs to make any mistake in the matter.

Those who plead that they cannot understand this plain and decisive statement—which if they are obedient, means so much to them, in blessings which will be received, when even the windows of heaven will be opened, and blessings poured out to overflowing—are not honest before God.
