But the Lord has instructed me in regard to this matter.

But just go to work in the fear of God. Make no great spread, but keep self out of sight and let Jesus appear, and commence in a humble manner. It is not best to arouse in this country, and in such a place as Geneva, the special attention of the clergy. If you enter large halls and then have to come down to the smaller buildings, it will not have the best influence. It would be best to take the lowly seat and then come up higher.—Letter 24, 1885, pp. 1, 2. (To Daniel T.

When this is kept before the people, creature merit sinks into insignificance. The more the eye looks upon Him, the more His life, His lessons, His perfection of character are studied, the more sinful and abhorrent will sin appear. By beholding, man can but admire and become more attracted to Him, more charmed, and more desirous to be like Jesus until he assimilates to His image and has the mind of Christ.

If every minister who claims to love Jesus will only be filled with His charms and become assimilated to His image, what an example would he give to his brethren and to the world!

Just as soon as the love of God takes its place, there is the image and superscription of Jesus Christ. His entire life amid a world filled with pride and selfishness was without an exception an embodiment of that charity that suffereth long, and is kind: that envieth not; that “vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.” (1 Corinthians 13:4-7.) Here is presented before us the fruits of the grace of God which every follower of Christ will manifest in his life and reveal in his character. If those manifestations are wanting, there must be most earnest seeking of God.

He does not specify all his wrongs but gives him a chance to manifest that he is a true child of God by his repentance and confession, not only of the sins specified but of those which conscience sets in order before him. In doing this work he reveals he has made an open rupture with Satan and with sin. He feels his weakness, he lays hold with earnest purpose and living faith upon the strength of God, and is an overcomer. Great becomes his peace, his joy, for it comes from the Lord, and there is nothing more acceptable in the sight of God than the continual humiliation of the soul before Him. These evidences are unmistakable proofs that the Lord has touched hearts by His Holy Spirit. More wonderful than miracles of physical healing is the miracle wrought in the child of God in wrestling with natural defects and overcoming them.

The men who accept the position of educators should be men who are in communion with God. If they dare to assume these responsibilities, while they do not keep a connection with the source of all wisdom, while they trust to their own human judgment, they incur guilt upon their souls, for they bring unsanctified maxims and customs and devisings into the most sacred work ever committed to mortals. These men lead astray those who depend upon them, and trust in them. If those who learn lessons from them are not ruined body and soul, it is not because of any saving virtue in these ancients. It is because the people themselves are alarmed by the developments in themselves and their teachers. Let the teachers in our schools, from the highest to the lowest, come under the instruction of the divine Teacher, learning His meekness and lowliness of heart. Their own souls, and the souls under their care, will be in peril as long as they remain in their present position: Let every man and woman arouse to a sense of their God-given responsibility.

At that time one error after another pressed in upon us; ministers and doctors brought in new doctrines. We would search the Scriptures with much prayer, and the Holy Spirit would bring the truth to our minds.

The righteousness of God never covers a soul all polluted with sin. John says, “Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.” Will you let Him take it away? You cannot bear your own sin. Christ says He will take your sin if you lay hold of the merits of a crucified and risen Saviour.

God has entrusted His sacred work to men, and He asks that they shall do it carefully. Regularity in all things is essential. Never be late to an appointment. In no department or office should time be lost in unnecessary conversations. The work of God requires things which it does not receive, because men do not learn from the God of wisdom. They press too many things into their life, postpone until tomorrow that which demands their attention today, and much time is lost in painfully picking up the lost stitches.

There should be regular hours for rising, for family worship, for meals and for work. And it is a religious duty, in every one of our institutions, to maintain this by precept as well as by a firm example.

Elder C stated to Willie that when he entered the work he knew that he was not prepared to preach. Others also presented themselves at the same time that he did, and all were allotted some place to work as beginners. He urged that he should be allowed to go as tent master with one of the ministers, and learn how to work, but Elder B did not regard his request. He asked if they were not going to give him something to do, and Elder B told him to go out to some country town and hammer away, to go to work in school houses. He feels that he has not had a fair chance, and I hope that his case will not be passed over without due attention. Give him a chance to learn the lessons that he should have had an opportunity to learn years ago. He is fearful that he is to be sent to America and then be dropped out of the work, but this should not be. He has some excellent qualifications although Australia is not his place. Please give Elder C a chance somewhere, and in order to know where to put him you must get acquainted with him.—Letter 39, 1892, p. 1. (To O. A.

In the last mail I wrote you something in regard to Elder C. We all feel greatly relieved that he is no longer in Australia. The church in Adelaide where Brother C made his home, has been strangely neglected. The man devoted much of his time to his own enterprises, and took no care of the church. The sick were not visited, the desponding were not comforted, and the influence of this neglect is now felt by us who are here. Yesterday Elder [G.C.] Tenney read me a letter from a brother in Adelaide, in whom all have confidence, which set forth the condition of things. His course in money matters has been very much after the order that D pursued. Means was entrusted to him toward the building of a meeting-house, and, thinking to replace it, he used this means, and then hardly knew how much he had appropriated. He was paid more salary than any other man in the conference. It is a great pity that he was ever sent here across the wide ocean. I cannot understand what kind of discernment those in office could have had to advise this step. All feel wondrously relieved that he is no longer to labor in this conference."},{"refcode_short":"8MR 453.1","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 8 [Nos. 526-663], p. 453.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"At the very commencement of the conference we had a long meeting of three hours with the ministers alone and the Spirit of the Lord was upon me. Calling each person by name, I laid out the true condition of each one. Especially did I open before Elder C his method of labor. Oh, how he cried, and yet I could see that while he was depreciating himself there was an attempt at justification, as though after all he was not so bad, but I could not allow it. I told them all that I knew their situation. I told how wrong it was to receive pay as ministers and yet neglect the flock, leaving them to perish. I told them the Lord did not accept their labors. Then confessions were made, and prayer was offered together that He would mercifully heal the wounds that they had given to the cause."},{"refcode_short":"8MR 453.2","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 8 [Nos. 526-663], p. 453.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I have talked with Elder C twice since then in regard to his increasing family, that brought such burdens upon his wife.

I am fully pleased with the place. I think much of the people and am sore distressed when I consider how much might have been done that is not done because of unconsecrated workers. It is these thoughts that distress me and wear me, that our General Conference should make such unwise moves as have been made in sending Elder C here to Australia, and that the Conference in Australia should not have examined his work and changed this order of things. Now the neglect of doing that which was manifestly the duty of someone to do, has left a burden on this Conference to be especially liberal in doing a work now to redeem the past and make, as far as in their power, restitution for the past neglect, for Elder C is supposed to have the endorsement of the Conference, and thus leaves a guilt upon the Conference for sustaining a man who was remiss in his duty, unfaithful to his charge, giving lessons in dealing with the supposed erring, contrary to the Bible rule, which now have to be counteracted and an entirely different mold given to the church. This business is to me a sad and sorrowful one. And it is not a feeble effort or short work that can make a sufficient change and leave a healthful, wholesome influence in the church, which will be abiding.—Letter 84, 1892, p. 2. (To W. C.

She is helped. I prayed with them. She has promised to attend meeting again with the church.

But Elder C knew not how to deal with them, and he has wounded and bruised and driven away Sister H. Brother H was for eight years an active worker in the Presbyterian church, taking charge of the Sunday school, until he embraced the truth. Then he took charge of the Sabbath school, and in the absence of a preacher conducted the meetings. Through Elder C's mismanagement he was relieved of every office, yet he would not give up the truth or forsake the church. About the time we came, he was in a position of sore temptation, but he is strengthened and established by the things that he has heard. His wife is a woman of great firmness, of decided opinions, and independent judgment. She has much push, and if consecrated, would be an aggressive worker. I have no doubt now that she will come along if she is rightly treated, and the Lord will be glorified if this sheep that has been driven away is restored to the fold. I shall see them once more in their home before I leave. I have perfect liberty in speaking plain things to them in love.—Letter 29a, 1892, pp. 1, 2. (To W. C.

The picture of Mary has a man's face, the representations of Christ with the two fingers prominent, while the others are closed, is wholly a Catholic sign and I object to this.
