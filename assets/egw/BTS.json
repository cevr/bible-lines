But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but My Father only. But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

Christ has warned us to look for His second coming. He says, “Watch therefore, for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. ... Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?” Everyone of us may well ask, “Does this scripture refer to me? Lord, is it I?” “Blessed is that servant,” Christ says, “whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. Verily I say unto you, that he shall make him ruler over all his goods. But if that evil servant shall say in his heart, my lord delayeth his coming, and shall begin to smite his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”"},{"refcode_short":"BTS June 1,  1902, par. 5","refcode_long":"Bible Training School June 1,  1902, paragraph 5","content":"Every Christian is now to stand in his lot.

It is meat-eating and liquor-drinking that are making the world as it was in the days of Noah. These things are strengthening the lower passions of human beings, animalizing the race. By giving way to base passions, man is corrupting body, soul, and spirit. The murders committed by men under the influence of strong drink shows what a cruel, satanic spirit strong drink inspires in a man. Often the liquor sold is adulterated, poisoned; and those who drink it are made mad. Under its influence they show a satanic ferocity.

At the foundation of liquor-drinking lie wrong habits of eating. Those who believe present truth should refuse to drink tea or coffee; for these excite a desire for stronger stimulants.

But such make a great mistake. God's word declares, “Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.” The subject of temperance, in all its bearings, has an important place in the working out of our salvation.

Consistency is a jewel. Our faith, our dress, and our deportment must be in harmony with the character of our work, the presentation of the most solemn message ever given to the world. Our work is to win men to belief of the truth, win by preaching and by example, also by living godly lives. The truth in all its bearings is to be acted, showing the consistency of faith with practice. The value of our faith will be shown by its fruit. The Lord can and will impress men by our intense earnestness. Our dress, our deportment, our conversation and the depth of a growing experience in spiritual lines, all are to show that the great principles of truth we are handling are a reality to us.

We want men who will make it their first business to wrestle with God in prayer, and then go forth in the wisdom of the inspiration that God can give. Then we are a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men. If men would not have their minds darkened, their hearts hardened, they must obey God at any cost to themselves.

Satan will strive to retain every soul in his strong power. He will not willingly let go his dominion over men who have influence upon other minds. Therefore God's own methods of advancing the gospel in his dominion are met by great opposition from the whole synagogue of the satanic agencies.

The promise is, “Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.” But when in trouble they think that they must write to their earthly friends, telling them their perplexities, and begging for help.

And that good pleasure is to have you abide in Christ, rest in His love. You must not let anything rob your soul of peace, of restfulness, of the assurance that you are accepted just now. Appropriate every promise; all are yours on condition of your complying with the Lord's prescribed terms. Entire surrender of your ways, which seem so very wise, and taking Christ's ways, is the secret of perfect rest in His love. Giving up one's life to Him means much more than we suppose. We must learn His meekness and lowliness before we realize the fulfillment of the promise, “Ye shall find rest unto your souls.” It is by learning the habits of Christ, His meekness, His lowliness, that self becomes transformed,—by taking Christ's yoke upon you and then submitting to learn. There is no one who has not much to learn. All must come under training by Jesus Christ. When they fall upon Christ, their own hereditary and cultivated traits of character are taken away as hindrances to their being partakers of the divine nature.

All your trouble is because you are so anxious to run things yourselves that you do not wear the yoke of Christ, which He declares is easy.

When the judgment shall sit, and the books are opened, many will be surprised by God's estimate of character. They will realize that God sees not as man sees, that He judges not as human beings judge. He reads the heart. He knows the motives that prompt the action, and He recognizes and commends every faithful effort put forth for Him. The Lord uses various gifts in His work. Let no worker think that his gifts are superior to those of another worker. Let God be the judge. He tests and approves His workers, and He places a just estimate on their qualifications.

Through the Holy Spirit the Lord works with the human agent. “He hath appointed us to preach good tidings unto the meek; He hath sent us to bind up the broken-hearted; to proclaim liberty to the captives; and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God: to comfort all that mourn, to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion; to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that He might be glorified.” The Sun of Righteousness has arisen. Christ is waiting to clothe His people with the garments of salvation. And “He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till He have set judgment in the earth; and the isles shall wait for His law.” His glory shall be seen upon thee.

Good works are indispensable as the fruit of faith, and are the sure evidence that we have passed from death unto life, because we love our believing brethren.

The finite can only endure the finite measure, and human nature succumbs; but the nature of Christ had a greater capacity for suffering; for the human existed in the Divine nature, and created a capacity for suffering to endure that which resulted from the sins of a lost world.

Satan will walk with him, but speak aloud to God, and He will drive back the hellish shadow of Satan. With humble, subdued, thankful hearts they will come forth saying, Thy gentleness hath made me great."},{"refcode_short":"BTS June 1,  1917, par. 4","refcode_long":"Bible Training School June 1,  1917, paragraph 4","content":"The sincere seeker comes forth from the audience with God, rich in the assurance of His love, to go forth to distil a heavenly fragrance wherever he goes. He can talk of the righteousness of Christ, he can talk of the love of God with sincerity. He has tasted, and he knows the Lord is good. This work is to be done in all our churches. Christ, His love, His forgiveness, His purity, is to be the theme upon which we are to dwell. The charms of Jesus are to be kept ever before our minds, charged with the elevated character of the true model that every soul must copy. Let us turn our eyes from everything that would dishearten and discourage. Satan will seek to distort everything to our vision, and make a mountain of a mole hill. Our eyes must be fixed on Jesus."}]
