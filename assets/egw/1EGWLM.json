It seems most probable that Paul never thought that his letters to Philemon, Timothy, and Titus would become public. But we are all thankful that they did.

Most of the time she was surrounded by receptive people, but there were also occasions in which she met strong opposition while rebuking error.

Millerites generally believed that probation would close for the world just before the second coming of Jesus. In October, soon after Miller accepted the autumn 1844 date for the fulfillment of the 2300 days, he concluded that probation had already closed.3William Miller, “Brother Miller's Letter, on the Seventh Month,” Midnight Cry, Oct. 12, 1844, p. 122; idem, “Letter From William Miller,” Advent Herald, Nov. 27, 1844, p. 127.

The Advent Mirror did not teach that the “door of mercy” was closed for everyone.

They made the parable allegorical of their 1844 experience, and believed that on or about October 22, 1844, Jesus had gone into a heavenly wedding. The Advent Mirror divided the marriage into two steps: the actual marriage and the marriage supper. The marriage, it was argued, occurred in heaven and preceded the literal Second Coming. Turner and Hale presented the coming of the Son of man to the Ancient of Days in Daniel 7:9, 10, 13, 14, as describing events connected with a heavenly marriage. The Ancient of Days—God the Father—sat in judgment and gave to the Son of man—Jesus—“dominion, glory and a kingdom.” Christ was made king as He received the New Jerusalem at the marriage. Then, as king, Jesus went from the wedding to the “marriage supper,” which occurred when He gathered His saints at the Second Coming. Thus they linked the autumn 1844 date to the marriage that they believed confirmed the soon return of Jesus. The Advent Mirror placed post-Disappointment Advent believers in the “guest chamber” waiting for the marriage supper. The guest-chamber concept came from another parable found in Matthew 22:1-14. The “guests,” or the faithful ones on earth, were waiting for Jesus to come literally to the earth from the heavenly wedding. They further argued that the “guests,” or virgins, had responded to the call leading up to the tenth day of the seventh month on October 22, 1844, “Behold, the bridegroom cometh.” They had trimmed their lamps and had gone figuratively to meet the Bridegroom.11A.

He believed that Jesus completed His work as a high priest in the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary on one day, “the tenth day of the seventh month.” Having laid aside His priestly robes, He put on His kingly robes and began to reign.

The next year William Sheldon, the first published non-Sabbatarian Adventist critic of Ellen White, also argued similarly that she could not be a true prophet because she did not believe the Sabbath until more than a year and a half after receiving her first vision and then in later years considered keeping the first day of the week as the “mark of the beast.”70William Sheldon, Visions and Theories, pp. 3, 4.

But as he contemplated the 2300 days/years of Daniel 8:14 he could not reconcile what he was shown with Jeremiah's prophecy.

Yet even after that experience others on the Jerusalem Council were reluctant to accept the conversion of Gentiles to Christianity unless they also converted to Judaism.

Bates, who had traveled the world as a sea captain, understood the effect of latitude on sunrise and sunset. He concluded that evening began at 6:00 p.m. and that this was the correct time to begin the Sabbath.74Bates, The Seventh Day Sabbath, p. 32.

Presented first by William Miller, the shut door was connected to the October 1844 disappointment. For a short time most Adventists believed that the world had been warned of the soon coming of Jesus and had either accepted or rejected the message. Soon, though, Adventism split into two groups. The mainline group abandoned the October 1844 date, looked to a future fulfillment of the prophecies, and resumed evangelistic work.

Key individuals such as Samuel Snow and Joseph Turner argued that Jesus had completed His one-day work as high priest in the Most Holy Place on October 22, 1844. Others, such as O.R.L. Crosier, Emily Clemons, and Ellen White, believed that Jesus had begun a final extended atonement as high priest on October 22, 1844.

In January 1847 Joseph Bates linked Jesus’ ministry in the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary to the Sabbath and the Ten Commandments. This linkage suggested that the Sabbath needed to be promoted and shared in light of its eschatological importance.

The Sabbath as the seal of God required that a Sabbath proclamation be given to the world before Jesus could return. This put further strain on the idea of a shut door for “sinners.” Sabbatarian Adventists began to emphasize the open door into the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary, and the term shut door was redefined to mean something very different from a shut door of probation. It came to represent the validity of the 1844 experience that Sabbatarian Adventism had embraced.

Ellen White never denied salvation to individuals, but the tenor of her statements and those closely connected with her suggests that for a time she continued to believe that evangelistic work for the unconverted world had ended. Her visions did not require this understanding, however, and theologically led to a more open view. Her first vision, while referring to the “wicked world which God had rejected,” can be understood in terms of the spiritual rejection principle. Her February 1845 Bridegroom vision portrayed Jesus as still ministering as a high priest; her October 1845 time of trouble vision indicated that the “sealing” and the great time of trouble had not yet begun and thus suggested that probation had not yet closed; her March and April 1847 Sabbath halo visions revealed that the Sabbath was to be proclaimed more fully before Jesus would return; and her autumn 1848 and March 1849 sealing message visions revealed that Jesus was holding back the winds of strife until God's people could be sealed and that Jesus had opened the door into the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 57.4","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

The wedding imagery is first introduced about two months after the first vision, in the vision of February 1845. See notes under Lt 1, 1846 (Feb. 15). it may be my duty to give you a short sketch of what God has revealed to me. The dear saints have got many trials to pass through. But our light afflictions which are but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.5 Cf. 2 Cor. 4:17, 18. The report of this vision contains many scriptural allusions, only a few of which are noted in the annotations. James White supplied more than 40 references in his reprint of the vision in A Word to the “Little Flock,” pp. 14-18. I have tried to bring back a good report, & a few grapes from the heavenly Canaan, for which many would stone me, as the congregation bade stone Caleb and Joshua for their report, (Num. 14:10.) But I declare to you, my brother in the Lord, it is a goodly land, and we are well able to go up and possess it. While praying at the famly [sic] altar the Holy Ghost fell on me and I seemed to be rising higher and higher, far above the dark world. I turned to look for the Advent people in the world, but could not find them, when a voice said to me, Look again, and look a little higher. At this, I raised my eyes and see [sic] a strait and narrow path, cast up high above the world. On this path the Advent people were traveling to the City, which was at the farther end of the path. They had a bright light set up behind them at the first end of the path, which an angel told me was the Midnight Cry.6 The expression “midnight cry” is an allusion to the warning cry “Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him,” given at midnight in the parable of the 10 virgins (Matt. 25:6). As it is used here it refers to the powerful proclamation during the late summer and autumn of 1844 announcing the second coming of Christ on October 22. Even though the predicted Advent failed to materialize, this first vision declares the Midnight Cry to be “a bright light.” No information is given at this stage regarding in what way the seemingly discredited Midnight Cry contained light from God. This light shone all along the path and gave light for their feet so they might not stumble. And if they kept their eyes fixed on Jesus, who was just before them, leading them to the City, they were safe. But soon some grew weary, and said the City was a great way off, and they expected to have entered it before. Then Jesus would encourage them by raising his glorious right arm, and from his arm came a glorious light which waved over the Advent band, and they shouted, Hallelujah! Others rashly denied the light behind them, and said that it was not God that had led them out so far. The light behind them went out which left their feet in perfect darkness, and they stumbled and got their eyes off the mark and lost sight of Jesus, and fell off the path down in the dark and wicked world below. It was just as impossible for them to get on the path again & go to the City, as all the wicked world which God had rejected.7 Two groups are portrayed here as rejected by God: (1) those who had initially accepted the Second Advent message (“Midnight Cry”) but later rejected it; (2) “all the wicked world,” composed of persons who had never professed a faith in the Second Advent. Although we are not told specifically why God “rejected” the members of the second group, the implication is that like the first group, it was because they had wickedly rejected the Advent message.\nConcerning members of the first group—those who at first accepted but later rejected the Midnight Cry—William Miller initially took a view similar to that of this vision. They “were crying for mercy a few days since … [but] are now scoffing and mocking us.” He then added the pointed question “Have not such individuals sinned against the Holy Ghost?” (see William Miller to I. E. Jones, in Advent Herald, Dec. 25, 1844, p. 154). For biblical examples of probation closing on certain classes and groups of people, see Francis D. Nichol, Ellen G. White and Her Critics, pp. 206-210.\nMuch discussion has ensued through the years as to the extent and size of the second group—“all the wicked world which God had rejected.” Some have held that “the wicked world” refers to the entire population of the world (apart from the loyal Advent believers), since, presumably, in a general sense all humanity is “wicked” and sinful. While this is a reasonable interpretation of the phrase “all the wicked world” taken on its own, the context suggests (as argued above) that “the wicked world” refers to a much more circumscribed group, viz., that which had specifically rejected, maligned, and mocked the Advent proclamation. This would accord with Ellen White's own interpretation of the passage in 1883 when she was called upon to explain its omission in later printings of the vision:\n“Two classes are brought to view in the vision—those who declared the light which they had followed a delusion, and the wicked of the world who, having rejected the light, had been rejected of God. No reference is made to those who had not seen the light, and therefore were not guilty of its rejection” (Ms 4, 1883, quoted in Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 64).\nAn example of the second, more restricted, interpretation of “wicked world” can be seen in another passage from William Miller: “And the wicked world, who have scoffed at the idea of Christ's second coming … and laughed and ridiculed the servants of Christ … will be silent.” Apollos Hale and Joseph Turner likewise used “world” in a very specific manner when they wrote of “the world” that had “rejected the [Advent] truth” and “turned away their ears with loathing from its warnings and promises.” (See William Miller, Evidence From Scripture and History, p. 188; A. Hale and J. Turner, “Has Not the Savior Come as the Bridegroom?” Advent Mirror, January 1845, pp. 3, 4.)\nThe bibliography of published comment and debate on “the wicked world” passage is extensive. For contrasting interpretations, see, e.g., Uriah Smith, The Visions of Mrs. E. G. White, pp. 29-31; W. W. Fletcher, The Reasons for My Faith, pp. 188, 205, 206; Francis D. Nichol, Ellen G. White and Her Critics, pp. 212-214; Rolf J. Poehler, “‘… and the Door Was Shut,’” pp. 109, 110, 127, 128; Herbert E. Douglass, Messenger of the Lord, pp. 557, 558.\nFor surveys of the “shut door” debates of the time, see P. Gerard Damsteegt, Foundations of the Seventh-day Adventist Message and Mission, pp. 106-112; George R. Knight, Millennial Fever, pp. 236-242; Ingemar Lindén, 1844 and the Shut Door Problem, pp.19-23.

They fell all the way along the path one after another, until we heard the voice of God like many waters, which gave us the day and hour of Jesus’ coming.8 In A Word to the “Little Flock” James White provides an early discussion of this prediction, contrasting it with Millerite thinking on “the voice of God.” Note that according to the sequence described in this vision, the “day and hour of Jesus’ coming” is announced after the close of probation and apparently only a short time before the Second Advent. When some subsequently alleged that Ellen White claimed to know the day and hour of Jesus’ coming, having been shown it in vision, she responded, “I have not the slightest knowledge as to the time spoken by the voice of God. I heard the hour proclaimed, but had no remembrance of that hour after I came out of vision.”\nSee: James White, “The Voice of God,” in A Word to the “Little Flock,” pp. 4-8; Ellen G. White, Lt 38, 1888 (Aug. 11). The living saints, 144,000,9 See: EGWEnc, s.v. “144,000.” in number, know and understand the voice, while the wicked thought it was thunder & an earthquake. When God spake the time, he poured on us the Holy Ghost, and our faces began to light up and shine with the glory of God as Moses did when he came down from Mount Sinai, (Ex. 34:30-34.) By this time the 144,000 were all sealed10 See: EGWEnc, s.v. “Seal of God.” and perfectly united. On their foreheads was written, God, New Jerusalem, and a glorious Star containing Jesus’ new name.11 Cf. Rev. 3:12; Rom. 16:16. At our happy, holy state the wicked were enraged, and would rush violently up to lay hands on us to thrust us in prison,12 That the saints would experience violent persecution just prior to the Second Coming, as portrayed here, was not featured in Millerite prophetic exposition, at least during the final years of the movement. “An idea is abroad that a great time of persecution and martyrdom is before the church,” wrote Josiah Litch in 1840, “but I cannot find it in the Bible.” Thus, for example, Litch held that the terrors of the seven last plagues would be poured out on the wicked after the Second Advent, when the saints had already been delivered, not before. Hale and Jacobs argued that the “time of trouble” predicted in Daniel 12:1 would not touch the saints, who would be delivered before it started. On the matter of the seven last plagues, major Millerite expositors such as Apollos Hale, Enoch Jacobs, and C. S. Minor agreed with Litch. William Miller had a different view, holding that six of the seven plagues were already past, being symbolic of the judgments of God on the Papacy going back to the Reformation. While he thought the seventh plague was still future, it did not presage any special persecution for the saints other than what they had always had to endure throughout the centuries. Thus on this point the vision given to Ellen Harmon constituted a major departure from mainstream Millerite thinking. This probably explains why, when this vision was included in the pamphlet A Word to the “Little Flock” 16 months later, James White felt it necessary to include a section offering biblical support for the position “that the seven last plagues were all in the future, and that they were all to be poured out before the first resurrection.” For White himself, this represented a reversal of his earlier Millerite position.\nSee: L. [Josiah Litch], “The Battle of Armageddon (concluded),” Signs of the Times, Sept. 15, 1840, p. 95; Josiah Litch, Prophetic Expositions, p. 175; A. Hale, Herald of the Bridegroom! pp. 23, 29; E. Jacobs, “Seventh Seal,” Midnight Cry, Oct. 26, 1843, p. 82; C. S. M. [C. S. Minor], “His Coming,” Midnight Cry, Sept. 21, 1843, p. 36; William Miller, Evidence From Scripture and History, pp. 219-232; James White, “The Seven Last Plagues,” in James White, ed., A Word to the “Little Flock,” pp. 1-4. when we would stretch forth the hand in the name of the Lord, and the wicked would fall helpless to the ground. Then it was that the synagogue of Satan13 The imagery used here is taken from Revelation 3:9, in which religious opponents of the people of God (“synagogue of Satan”) are finally brought to humbly acknowledge that those they had bitterly opposed were “loved by God.” For further comment, see Lt 2, 1847 (Apr. 21), note 5. knew that God had loved us who could wash one another's feet, and salute the holy brethren with a holy kiss,14 It is interesting to note the positive mention, already in this first vision, of the ancient Christian liturgical practices of foot washing and the “holy kiss.” It marks an early expression of the restorationist ideal which was to become central to Seventh-day Adventist theological development. Following New Testament admonitions to “salute one another with an holy kiss” (Rom. 16:16, etc.) this practice found its way into the worship services of the early church. “Having ended the prayers, we salute one another with a kiss,” Justin Martyr reported in the second century (First Apology I. 65). Gradually, however, the “holy kiss” became restricted to a few special ceremonial occasions, such as the consecration of bishops. A somewhat similar historical trajectory can be traced in connection with liturgical foot washing as instituted by Jesus (John 13). With the coming of the Reformation, most Reformers elected not to reinstate these practices; the exception was the Anabaptists, among whom the holy kiss and foot washing were revived. The situation in mid-nineteenth-century America remained largely the same, with only a minority of smaller churches, such as the Mennonites (of the Anabaptist tradition) and the Dunkards, maintaining these practices while the mainline Protestant churches rejected them.\nSee: The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, s.v. “Kiss of Peace,” by Victor Schultze; Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, s.v. “Feet-Washing,” by G. A. Frank Knight; The Mennonite Encyclopedia, s.v. “Kiss,” by James Reusser. For a recent discussion of the restoration motif in Seventh-day Adventist theology, see Hans K. LaRondelle, “The Remnant and the Three Angels’ Messages,” in Handbook of Seventh-day Adventist Theology, pp. 880-889. and they worshipped at our feet. Soon our eyes were drawn to the East, for a small black cloud had appeared about half as large as a man's hand, which we all knew was the Sign of the Son of Man. We all in solemn silence gazed on the cloud as it drew nearer, lighter, and brighter, glorious, and still more glorious, till it was a great white cloud. The bottom appeared like fire, a rainbow was over it, around the cloud were ten thousand angels singing a most lovely song. And on it sat the Son of Man, on his head were crowns, his hair was white and curly and lay on his shoulders. His feet had the appearance of fire, in his right hand was a sharp sickle, in his left a silver trumpet. His eyes were as a flame of fire, which searched his children through and through. Then all faces gathered paleness, and those that God had rejected gathered blackness. Then we all cried out, who shall be able to stand? Is my robe spotless? Then the angels ceased to sing, and there was some time of awful silence, when Jesus spoke, Those who have clean hands and a pure heart shall be able to stand, my grace is sufficient for you. At this, our faces lighted up, and joy filled every heart. And the angels struck a note higher and sung again while the cloud drew still nearer the earth. Then Jesus’ silver trumpet sounded, as he descended on the cloud, wrapped in flames of fire. He gazed on the graves of the sleeping saints then raised his eyes and hands to heaven & cried out, Awake! Awake! Awake! ye that sleep in the dust, and arise. Then there was a mighty earthquake. The graves opened, and the dead came up clothed with immortality. The 144,000 shouted, Hallelujah! as they recognized their friends who had been torn from them by death, and in the same moment we were changed and caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air. We all entered the cloud together, and were 7 days ascending to the sea of glass, when Jesus brought along the crowns and with his own right hand placed them on our heads. He gave us harps of gold and palms of victory. Here on the sea of glass the 144,000 stood in a perfect square. Some of them had very bright crowns, others not so bright. Some crowns appeared hung15 In subsequent printings, the apparent error of “hung” was corrected to “heavy.”\nSee: Ellen G. Harmon, Ms 1, 1846 (Apr. 6); James White, ed., A Word to the “Little Flock,” p. 15. with stars, while others had but few. All were perfectly satisfied with their crowns. And they were all clothed with a glorious white mantle from their shoulders to their feet. Angels were all about us as we marched over the sea of glass to the gate of the City. Jesus raised his mighty glorious arm, laid hold of the gate and swung it back on its golden hinges, and said to us, You have washed your robes in my blood, stood stiffly for my truth, enter in. We all marched in and felt we had a perfect right in the City. Here we see [sic] the tree of life, & the throne of God. Out of the throne came a pure river of water, and on either side of the river was the tree of life.16 The description given in this section leaves no doubt that after the resurrection the saints ascend to heaven, where are “the City,” the tree of life, and the river of life. On this point, in interesting ways the account diverges from mainstream Millerism of the time. William Miller's conclusion, accepted almost universally in his movement, was that at Christ's coming both the “living and raised saints will be caught up to meet the Lord in the air. Then the saints will be judged and presented to the Father without spot or wrinkle. … And while this is being done in the air, the earth will be cleansed by fire. … Then Christ and his people will come down from the heavens, or middle air, and live with his saints on the new earth in a new heaven, or dispensation, forever.” The idea that the saints ascend to heaven after the resurrection is not found in Millerite accounts. The saints are “in the air” or “middle air” awaiting the purification of the earth. The focus is on the earth to which the saints descend with the Holy City once the earth has been cleansed, to spend the millennium and beyond.\nThe Millerite concept of an earthly millennium was retained in the writings of Joseph Bates as late as 1847. Prior to Christ's “second appearing,” he wrote in 1847, He receives “the Holy City, which is the capital of his kingdom, that he will bring with him and establish here, and it will ever be the capital of all his dominions under the whole heaven” (Second Advent Waymarks, p. 57).\nJames White likewise maintained in 1846 that “Christ is coming to raise the dead saints and change those who are alive. Christ is coming to restore this earth to its primitive purity. He is coming to set up His everlasting kingdom and reign. Christ is to be king. The Land promised to Abraham and enlarged in Dan. 7: and Isaiah 65: is to be the territory, the spiritual seed of Abram, the subjects, etc.” (In a memory statement made 10 years later, in 1855, James White claimed that the Millerite preacher E. R. Pinney had taught “that the Kingdom of God would not be established on the earth till the close of the seventh millennium,” and that he, White, had “taught the same since 1845.” However, the above extract suggests that it was somewhat later that he took this view.) It would seem, then, that the vision of December 1844 contained hints of a heavenly millennium well before this theme was developed by Sabbatarian Adventists.\nSee: “Synopsis of Mr. Miller's Views,” Midnight Cry, Nov. 22, 1842, p. [2]; Joseph Bates, Second Advent Waymarks and High Heaps, p. 57; James White to “Brother Collins,” Aug. 26, 1846; J. W. [James White], “A Test,” Review, Oct. 16, 1855, p. 61. For a comparison of Millerite with Seventh-day Adventist views on the millennium, see SDAE, s.v. “Millennium”; Alberto R. Timm, The Sanctuary and the Three Angels’ Messages, pp. 152, 153. On one side of the river was a trunk of a tree and a trunk on the other side of the river, both of pure transparent gold. At first I thought I see [sic] two trees. I looked again and see [sic] they were united at the top in one tree. So it was the tree of life on either side of the river of life. Its branches bowed to the place where we stood. And the fruit was glorious, which looked like gold mixed with silver. We all went under the tree, and sat down to look at the glory of the place, when Bro. Fitch [Charles Fitch],17 Identity: Charles Fitch (1805-1844) was a prominent Holiness Millerite minister who died on October 14, 1844, less than two weeks before the anticipated date for the Second Coming. See: SDAE, s.v. “Charles Fitch”; EGWEnc, s.v. “Charles Fitch.” and Stockman [Levi Stockman],18 Identity: Levi Stockman (1812-1844) was a respected Methodist Millerite minister who lived in Maine. He helped Ellen Harmon understand the love of God during her conversion process. He contracted tuberculosis and died before the 1844 disappointment. In this vision Ellen White is taken to the future and meets these men after the second coming of Jesus and the resurrection. See: SDAE, s.v. “Levi Stockman”; EGWEnc, s.v. “Levi Stockman.” who had preached the gospel of the kingdom, whom God had laid in the grave to save them, came up to us and asked us what we had passed through while they were sleeping. We tried to call up our greatest trials, but they looked so small compared with the far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory that surrounded us, that we could not speak them out, and we all cried out Hallelujah, heaven is cheap enough, and we touched our glorious harps and made heaven's arches ring. And as we were gazing at the glories of the place, our eyes were attracted upwards to something that had the appearance of silver. I asked Jesus to let me see what was within there. In a moment we were winging our way upward and entering in. Here we saw good old father Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Noah, Daniel, and many like them. And I saw a veil with a heavy fringe of silver, and gold as a border on the bottom. It was very beautiful. I asked Jesus what was within the veil. He raised it with his own right arm, and bade me take heed. I saw there a glorious ark, overlaid with pure gold, and it had a glorious border resembling Jesus’ crowns. On it were two bright angels; their wings were spread over the ark as they sat on each end, with their faces turned towards each other and looking downward. In the ark, beneath where the angels [sic] wings were spread, was a golden pot of Manna of a yellowish cast, and I saw a rod, which Jesus said was Aarons [sic], I saw it bud, blossom, and bear fruit.—And I saw two long golden rods on which hung silver wires, and on the wires most glorious grapes. One cluster was more than a man here can carry. And I saw Jesus step up and take of the manna, almonds, grapes, and pomegranates, and bear them down to the city, and place them on the supper table. I steped [sic] up to see how much was taken away, and there was just as much left, and we shouted Hallelujah. Amen.19 From this point forward, Ellen White continues with an account of her “new earth” vision that describes the descent of the New Jerusalem to the earth following the millennium and the restoration of the earth to its Edenic state. The “new earth” vision was probably given in late spring or early summer of 1845. In this and her previous Midnight Cry vision she emphasized the tangible aspects of heaven and the new earth. Ellen White vigorously opposed the spiritualizing view of some Millerites who said that they were now spiritually living in the New Jerusalem. See Ellen G. White, Spiritual Gifts [vol. 2], pp. 52-56. We all descended from this place down into the city, and with Jesus at our head we all descended from the city down to this earth, on a great and mighty mountain, which could not bear Jesus up, and it parted asunder, and there was a mighty plain. Then we looked up and saw the great city with twelve foundations, twelve gates, three on each side, and an angel at each gate, and all cried out the city, the great city, it's coming, it's coming down from God, out of heaven, and it came and settled on the place where we stood. Then we began to look at the glorious things outside of the city. There I saw most glorious houses, that had the appearance of silver, supported by four pillars, set with pearls most glorious to behold, which were to be inhabited by the saints. In them was a golden shelf, I saw many of the saints go into the houses, take off their glittering crowns and lay them on the shelf, then go out into the field by the houses to do something with the earth, not as we have to do with the earth here; no, no. A glorious light shone all about their heads, and they were continually shouting and offering praises to God. And I saw another field full of all kinds of flowers, and as I plucked them, I cried out, well they will never fade. Next I saw a field of tall grass, most glorious to behold. It was living green, and had a reflection of silver and gold as it waved proudly to the glory of King Jesus. Then we entered a field full of all kinds of beasts; the lion, the lamb, the leopard and the wolf, altogether in perfect union. We passed through the midst of them, and they followed on peaceably after. Then we entered a wood, not like the dark woods we have here, no, no; but light, and all over glorious. The branches of the trees waved to and fro, and we all cried out, we will dwell safely in the wilderness and sleep in this woods. We passed through the wood, for we were on our way to Mount Zion, as we were traveling along we met a company who were also gazing at the glories of the place: I noticed red as a border on their garments. Their crowns were brilliant—their robes were pure white. As we greeted them, I asked Jesus who they were? He said they were martyrs that had been slain for him. With them was an innumerable company of little ones, they had a hem of red on their garments also. Mount Zion was just before us, and on the Mount sat a glorious temple,20 In his vision of the “holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven” John wrote, “I saw no temple therein” (Rev. 21:10, 22). Likewise, Ellen Harmon saw no temple in the Holy City in the earth made new. She did, however, see a temple on a mount “outside of the city,” although the main function of that temple is not revealed. Since sin and evil have now been eradicated forever, the temple cannot have the soteriological purpose it had served in heaven prior to the eradication of sin. Richard Davidson suggests that “at the consummation of salvation history, the heavenly sanctuary or temple apparently returns to its original doxological function.”\nSee: Richard M. Davidson, “Sanctuary Typology,” in Symposium on Revelation, pp. 99-130. and about it were seven other mountains, on which grew roses and lilies, and I saw the little ones climb, or if they chose use their little wings and fly to the top of the mountains, and pluck the never fading flowers. There were all kinds of trees around the temple to beautify the place. The box, the pine, the fir, the oil, the myrtle, the pomegranet [sic] and the fig tree, bowed down with the weight of its timely figs that made the place look all over glorious. And as we were about to enter the holy temple, Jesus raised his lovely voice and said, only the 144,000 enter this place, and we shouted Hallelujah. Well bless the Lord, Bro. Jacobs, it is an extra meeting for those who have the seal of the living God. This temple was supported by seven pillars, all of transparent gold, set with pearls most glorious. The glorious things I saw there, I cannot begin to describe. O, that I could talk in the language of Canaan, then could I tell a little of the glory of the upper world; but if faithful you soon will know all about it. I saw there the tables of stone in which the names of the 144,000, were engraved in letters of gold.—After we had beheld the glory of the temple, we went out. Then Jesus left us and went to the city. Soon we heard his lovely voice again, saying: Come my people; you have come out of great tribulation, and done my will, suffered for me; come in to supper, for I will gird myself, and serve you. We shouted Hallelujah, glory, and entered into the city, and I saw a table of pure silver, it was many miles in length, yet our eyes could extend over it. And I saw the fruit of the tree of life, the manna, almonds, figs, pomegranets [sic], grapes, and many other kinds of fruit. We all reclined at the table. I asked Jesus to let me eat of the fruit. He said, not now. Those who eat of the fruit of this land, go back to earth no more. But in a little while if faithful, you shall both eat of the fruit of the tree of life, and drink of the water of the fountain, and he said, you must go back to the earth again, and relate to others, what I have revealed to you. Then an angel bore me gently down to this dark world. Sometimes I think I cannot stay here any longer, all things of earth look so dreary. I feel very lonely here, for I have seen a better land. O, that I had wings like a dove, then would I fly away, and be at rest."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 93.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

See Lt 1, 1845 (Dec. 20). was written under a deep sense of duty, to you, not expecting you would publish it. Had I for once thought it was to be spread before the many readers of your paper, I should have been more particular and stated some things which I left out. As the readers of the Day-Star have seen a part of what God has revealed to me, and as the part which I have not written is of vast importance to the Saints; I humbly request you to publish this also in your paper. God showed me the following, one year ago this month:—I saw a throne, and on it sat the Father and his Son Jesus Christ.3 This is Ellen Harmon's first known account of her second major vision, sometimes referred to as her “Bridegroom” vision. According to her July 13, 1847, letter to Joseph Bates, it was received in Exeter, Maine, during her first trip to eastern Maine in mid-February 1845.\nSee: Ellen G. White, Lt 3, 1847 (July 13). I gazed on Jesus’ countenance and admired his lovely person. The Fathers person I could not behold for a cloud of glorious light covered him. I asked Jesus if his Father had a form like himself; He said he had, but I could not behold it; for, said he, if you should for once see the glory of his person, you would cease to exist.4 The vision's confirmation of the personality of God the Father and God the Son was in direct opposition to spiritualizing views gaining adherents among a small faction of post-1844 Millerites, eventually including Enoch Jacobs.\nSee: Ellen G. White, Spiritual Gifts [vol. 2], pp. 72-74. Enoch Jacobs's transition to Shakerism and related spiritualized views is documented by Merlin Burt in “Sabbatarian Adventism From 1844 to 1849,” pp. 231-242. Before the throne was the Advent people, the Church, and the world.5 I.e., the Millerites, the professed Christian churches, and unbelievers. The “praying company” next brought to view appears to represent those among them who are earnestly seeking for truth. I saw a company bowed down before the throne, deeply interested while most of them stood up disinterested and careless. Those who were bowed before the throne would offer up their prayers and look to Jesus, then he would look to his Father and appeared to be pleading with him. Then a light came from the Father to his Son and from him to the praying company. Then I saw an exceeding bright light6 In Ellen White's first vision a “bright light” illumines the pathway of the Advent people, which an angel identified as the “Midnight Cry.” See Lt 1, 1845 (Dec. 20), note 6. This affirmation of the “Midnight Cry,” the proclamation during the summer and autumn of 1844 pointing to October 22, 1844, as the time of the Second Advent, was at odds with what was rapidly becoming the majority opinion in post-Disappointment Adventism, viz., that the October date was a mistaken calculation of no particular prophetic significance. come from the Father to the Son and from the Son it waved over the people before the throne. But few would receive this great light. Many came out from under it and immediately resisted it. Others were careless and did not cherish the light and it moved off from them. Some cherished it and went and bowed down before the throne with the little praying company. This company all received the light, and rejoiced in it as their countenances shone with its glory. Then I saw the Father rise from the throne and in a flaming chariot go into the Holy of Holies within the vail, and did sit. There I saw thrones which I had not seen before. Then Jesus rose up from the throne, and most of those who were bowed down rose up with him. And I did not see one ray of light pass from Jesus to the careless multitude after he rose up, and they were left in perfect darkness.7 Cf. the description in Ellen White's first vision of those on the path who “rashly denied the light behind them,” resulting in its going out and leaving their feet “in perfect darkness” (Lt 1, 1845 [Dec. 20]).\nThis passage has been cited in partial support of the conclusion that this vision teaches the radical idea that the entire world, with the exception of the small Millerite group, was finally rejected by God. Note, however, the repeated qualifier made in this vision that it is those who are “careless,” who “resisted” and “did not cherish” light from God, who are left in darkness, not a blanket rejection of all non-Millerites. This “rejection” principle, which is found also in the first vision (Lt 1, 1845) but especially in this vision, undercuts the conclusion that these visions advocate the radical “shut door” standpoint (see Lt 1, 1845 [Dec. 20], note 7). Those who rose up when Jesus did, kept their eyes fixed on him as he left the throne, and led them out a little way, then he raised his right arm and we heard his lovely voice saying, wait ye, I am going to my Father to receive the Kingdom. Keep your garments spotless and in a little while I will return from the wedding, and receive you to myself. And I saw a cloudy chariot with wheels like flaming fire. Angels were all about the chariot as it came where Jesus was; he stepped into it and was borne to the Holiest where the Father sat. Then I beheld Jesus as he was before the Father a great High Priest.8 On two points in particular this passage presents an understanding of the wedding parable of Matthew 25 quite at odds with the established Millerite interpretation:\nThe coming of the Bridegroom to the marriage did not signify Christ's coming in glory to the earth to receive His waiting saints (the bride) at the close of the 2300 years, as the Millerites taught. Instead it signified the coming of Christ at that time to the Father in the Holy of Holies of the heavenly sanctuary, preparatory to the subsequent marriage.\nThe “marriage” of the parable indicated not Christ's reception of His church at the Second Coming but rather Christ's reception of “the Kingdom” from His Father prior to the Second Coming. Thus the “marriage” precedes the Second Coming. Biblical support for this sequence of events is alluded to in the words “in a little while I will return from the wedding, and receive you to myself,” a clear reference to the wedding parable of Luke 12, in which Christ's followers are admonished to be “like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding.”\nThe interpretation of the Matthew 25 marriage parable found in this vision represents one of several competing explanations for the Disappointment circulating among Adventists in the months following October 1844. It was first proposed in print in an extensive article by Apollos Hale and Joseph Turner a few weeks prior to the vision, in January 1845. This circumstance is probably what prompted Joseph Bates, two years later, to inquire whether Ellen Harmon had had “light on the Bridegroom's coming before” she saw it in vision. See notes on Lt 3, 1847 (July 13).\nSee: A. Hale and J. Turner, “Has Not the Savior Come as the Bridegroom?” Advent Mirror, January 1845. For an indication of the range of ideas circulating by February 1845 regarding what really happened on October 22, 1844, see I. E. Jones to William Miller, Feb. 15, 1845, in The Millerites and Early Adventists, sec. 5, reel 11. , 9 The theologically significant statement that Jesus was a “great High Priest” was counter to mainline “shut door” thought that emerged by the summer of 1845 and was promoted by Joseph Turner and Samuel Snow. They argued that Jesus reigned as king and was no longer a priest. See introductory article “The ‘Shut Door’ and Ellen White's Visions.”\nAlthough not explicitly stated, there is a strong suggestion here of a two-apartment heavenly sanctuary with Jesus transiting from the holy place to the Holy of Holies in 1844, a theme later to become prominent in Seventh-day Adventist theology. Unlike the theme of the coming of the Bridegroom mentioned earlier, the theme of Jesus coming to the Holy of Holies in 1844 is not known to have appeared in print prior to this vision (mid-February 1845). Probably not until the following month, March 1845, did O.R.L. Crosier and F. B. Hahn publish a similar view. There is some evidence, however, that similar ideas had oral circulation in certain places. Thus I. E. Jones, in a letter to William Miller on February 15, 1845, speaks of some persons in the Boston area who believed that on “the tenth of the 7th month … the Saviour then came out of the Holie [sic] of Holies … others, that he never entered the Holie of Holies till then” (emphasis in original).\nSee: O.R.L. Crosier and F. B. Hahn, reprint of early 1845 Day-Dawn issue published on last page of Ontario Messenger, Mar. 26, 1845; I. E. Jones to William Miller, Feb. 15, 1845, in The Millerites and Early Adventists. On the hem of his garment was a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate. Then Jesus shewed me the difference between faith and feeling. And I saw those who rose up with Jesus send up their faith to Jesus in the Holiest, and praying, Father give us thy spirit. Then Jesus would breathe on them the Holy Ghost. In the breath was light, power and much love, joy and peace. Then I turned to look at the company who were still bowed before the throne. They did not know that Jesus had left it. Satan appeared to be by the throne trying to carry on the work of God. I saw them look up to the throne and pray, My Father give us thy spirit. Then Satan would breathe on them an unholy influence. In it there was light and much power, but no sweet love, joy and peace. Satan's object was to keep them deceived and to draw back and deceive God's children.10 The vision's depiction of Satan's efforts to keep this group deceived implies that the door of probation was still open for believers who had not by faith followed Jesus into the Holy of Holies. It would take more time for the full ramifications of this view to be understood. In a note to “Dear Brethren and Sisters,” Ellen White later responded to misrepresentations of her comments about Satan's appearing before God's throne, and her descriptions of the movements of God the Father.\nSee: E. G. White, “Dear Brethren and Sisters,” Review, Apr. 14, 1853, p. 192. Merlin D. Burt, “Ellen White and the Shut Door,” in “Ellen White and Current Issues” Symposium, vol. 1, pp. 82, 83. I saw one after another leave the company who were praying to Jesus in the Holiest, go and join those before the throne and they at once received the unholy influence of Satan."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 99.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G. White Letters and Manuscripts: Volume 1, p. 99.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"About four months since, I had a vision of events, all in the future.11 There are good reasons to believe that this vision was given Ellen Harmon in October 1845 while on a visit to Carver, Massachusetts. According to James White, she received a vision at Carver, with similar content, in “the 7th month, 1845” of the Hebrew calendar, i.e., about October 1845. This harmonizes well with Ellen Harmon's statement that the vision was received “about four months since” the date of her letter, i.e., about mid-October 1845.\nJames White recalls in A Word to the “Little Flock” that both he and Ellen Harmon were surprised at the main thrust of this vision, viz., “that the saints must pass through the ‘time of Jacob's trouble,’” still future but preceding the Second Advent. James White credits this vision with disabusing him of his conviction that Christ would be coming “a few days” later, “at the 7th month, 1845.” While most Millerite expositors in 1843-1844 agreed that the “time of trouble” lay in the future, they believed that it would take place after the Advent, not before. The next eschatological event was the Second Advent, or, as Apollos Hale put it in 1843, “We have nothing to look for but the appearing of our Lord.” Furthermore, only the wicked would have to suffer the “time of trouble,” since the saints had already been delivered.\nSee: James White, ed., A Word to the “Little Flock,” p. 22. For examples of Millerite expositors prior to 1844 who placed “the time of trouble” after the Second Coming, see A. Hale, Herald of the Bridegroom!, pp. 21, 29, 33; E. Jacobs, “Seventh Seal,” Midnight Cry, Oct. 26, 1843, p. 81. And I saw the time of trouble,12 See: EGWEnc, s.v. “Time of Trouble.” such as never was,—Jesus told me it was the time of Jacob's trouble, and that we should be delivered out of it by the voice of God. Just before we entered it, we all received the seal of the living God.13 The predictions made in this passage seem to go counter to a radical shut-door position. First, the assertion that the Second Advent should not be expected momentarily because it would be preceded by “the time of Jacob's trouble.” Second, it is significant that the sealing of the saints is also described as a future event. This would directly contradict the most radical shut-door doctrine, i.e., that since October 22, 1844, the saints were permanently sealed and safe.\nSee: Rolf J. Poehler, “‘… and the Door Was Shut,’” pp. 113, 134; EGWEnc, s.v. “Seal of God.” Then I saw the four Angels cease to hold the four winds. And I saw famine, pestilence and sword, nation rose against nation, and the whole world was in confusion. Then we cried to God for deliverance day and night till we began to hear the bells on Jesus’ garment. And I saw Jesus rise up in the Holiest, and as he came out we heard the tinkling of bells, and knew our High Priest was coming out. Then we heard the voice of God which shook the heavens and earth, and gave the 144,000 the day and hour of Jesus’ coming.14 See: Lt 1, 1845 (Dec. 20), note 8. Then the saints were free, united and full of the glory of God, for he had turned their captivity. And I saw a flaming cloud come where Jesus stood and he laid off his priestly garment and put on his kingly robe, took his place on the cloud which carried him to the east where it first appeared to the saints on earth, a small black cloud, which was the sign of the Son of Man. While the cloud was passing from the Holiest to the east which took a number of days, the Synagogue of Satan worshiped at the saints [sic] feet.15 See: Lt 1, 1845 (Dec. 20), note 13."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 101","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

But our light afflictions, which are but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory—while we look not at the things which are seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.

I turned to look for the Advent people in the world, but could not find them—when a voice said to me, “Look again, and look a little higher.” At this I raised my eyes and saw a straight and narrow path, cast up high above the world. On this path the Advent people were travelling to the City, which was at the farther end of the path. They had a bright light set up behind them at the first end of the path, which an angel told me was the Midnight Cry. This light shone all along the path and gave light for their feet so they might not stumble. And if they kept their eyes fixed on Jesus, who was just before them, leading them to the City, they were safe. But soon some grew weary, and they said the City was a great way off, and they expected to have entered it before. Then Jesus would encourage them by raising his glorious right arm, and from his arm came a glorious light which waved over the Advent band, and they shouted Hallelujah! Others rashly denied the light behind them, and said that it was not God that had led them out so far. The light behind them went out leaving their feet in perfect darkness, and they stumbled and got their eyes off the mark and lost sight of Jesus, and fell off the path down in the dark and wicked world below. It was just as impossible for them to get on the path again and go to the City, as all the wicked world which God had rejected. They fell all the way along the path one after another, until we heard the voice of God like many waters, which gave us the day and hour of Jesus’ coming. The living saints, 144,000 in number, knew and understood the voice, while the wicked thought it was thunder and an earthquake. When God spake the time, he poured on us the Holy Ghost, and our faces began to light up and shine with the glory of God as Moses did when he came down from Mount Sinai, (Ex. 34:30-34.)"},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 102.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

On their foreheads was written, God, New Jerusalem, and a glorious Star containing Jesus’ new name. At our happy, holy state the wicked were enraged, and would rush violently up to lay hands on us to thrust us in prison, when we would stretch forth the hand in the name of the Lord, and the wicked would fall helpless to the ground. Then it was that the synagogue of Satan knew that God had loved us who could wash one another's feet, and salute the holy brethren with a holy kiss, and they worshipped at our feet. Soon our eyes were drawn to the East, for a small black cloud had appeared about half as large as a man's hand, which we all knew was the Sign of the Son of Man. We all in solemn silence gazed on the cloud as it drew nearer, lighter, and brighter, glorious, and still more glorious, till it was a great white cloud. The bottom appeared like fire, a rainbow was over it, around the cloud were ten thousand angels singing a most lovely song. And on it sat the Son of Man, on his head were crowns, his hair was white and curly and lay on his shoulders. His feet had the appearance of fire, in his right hand was a sharp sickle, in his left a silver trumpet. His eyes were as a flame of fire, which searched his children through and through. Then all faces gathered paleness, and those that God had rejected gathered blackness. Then we all cried out, who shall be able to stand? Is my robe spotless? Then the angels ceased to sing, and there was sometime of awful silence, when Jesus spoke. Those who have clean hands and a pure heart shall be able to stand, my grace is sufficient for you. At this, our faces lighted up, and joy filled every heart. And the angels struck a note higher and sung again while the cloud drew still nearer the earth. Then Jesus’ silver trumpet sounded, as he descended on the cloud, wrapped in flames of fire. He gazed on the graves of the sleeping saints, then raised his eyes and hands to heaven and cried out, Awake! Awake! Awake! ye that sleep in the dust, and arise. Then there was a mighty earthquake. The graves opened, and the dead came up clothed with immortality. The 144,000 shouted, Hallelujah! as they recognized their friends who had been torn from them by death, and in the same moment we were changed and caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air. We all entered the cloud together, and were seven days ascending to the sea of glass, when Jesus brought along the crowns and with his own right hand placed them on our heads. He gave us harps of gold and palms of victory. Here on the sea of glass the 144,000 stood in a perfect square. Some of them had very bright crowns, others not so bright. Some crowns appeared heavy with stars, while others had but few. All were perfectly satisfied with their crowns. And they were all clothed with a glorious white mantle from their shoulders to their feet. Angels were all about us as we marched over the sea of glass to the gate of the City. Jesus raised his mighty glorious arm, laid hold of the gate and swung it back on its golden hinges, and said to us, You have washed your robes in my blood, stood stiffly for my truth, enter in. We all marched in and felt we had a perfect right in the City. Here we saw the tree of life, and the throne of God. Out of the throne came a pure river of water, and on either side of the river was the tree of life. On one side of the river was a trunk of a tree and a trunk on the other side of the river, both of pure transparent gold."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 103.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

So it was the tree of life, on either side of the river of life; its branches bowed to the place where we stood; and the fruit was glorious, which looked like gold mixed with silver. We all went under the tree, and sat down to look at the glory of the place, when brothers Fitch [Charles Fitch] and Stockman [Levi Stockman], who had preached the gospel of the kingdom, and whom God had laid in the grave to save them, came up to us and asked us what we had passed through while they were sleeping. We tried to call up our greatest trials, but they looked so small compared with the far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory that surrounded us, that we could not speak them out, and we all cried out Hallelujah, heaven is cheap enough, and we touched our glorious harps and made heaven's arches ring. And as we were gazing at the glories of the place our eyes were attracted upwards to something that had the appearance of silver. I asked Jesus to let me see what was within there. In a moment we were winging our way upward, and entering in; here we saw good old father Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Noah, Daniel, and many like them. And I saw a veil with a heavy fringe of silver and gold as a border on the bottom; it was very beautiful. I asked Jesus what was within the veil. He raised it with his own right arm, and bade me take heed. I saw there a glorious ark, overlaid with pure gold, and it had a glorious border, resembling Jesus’ crowns; on it were two bright angels—their wings were spread over the ark as they sat on each end, with their faces turned towards each other and looking downward. In the ark, beneath where the angels wings were spread, was a golden pot of Manna, of a yellowish cast; and I saw a rod, which Jesus said was Aarons; I saw it bud, blossom and bear fruit. And I saw two long golden rods, on which hung silver wires, and on the wires most glorious grapes; one cluster was more than a man here could carry. And I saw Jesus step up and take off the manna, almonds, grapes and pomegranates, and bear them down to the city, and place them on the supper table. I stepped up to see how much was taken away, and there was just as much left; and we shouted Hallelujah—Amen. We all descended from this place down into the city, and with Jesus at our head we all descended from the city down to this earth, on a great and mighty mountain, which could not bear Jesus up, and it parted asunder, and there was a mighty plain. Then we looked up and saw the great city, with twelve foundations, twelve gates, three on each side, and an angel at each gate, and all cried out, “the city, the great city, it's coming, it's coming down from God, out of heaven;” and it came and settled on the place where we stood. Then we began to look at the glorious things outside of the city. There I saw most glorious houses, that had the appearance of silver, supported by four pillars, set with pearls, most glorious to behold, which were to be inhabited by the saints; in them was a golden shelf; I saw many of the saints go into the houses, take off their glittering crowns and lay them on the shelf, then go out into the field by the houses to do something with the earth; not as we have to do with the earth here; no, no. A glorious light shone all about their heads, and they were continually shouting and offering praises to God."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 104.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Then we entered a field full of all kinds of beasts—the lion, the lamb, the leopard and the wolf, altogether in perfect union; we passed through the midst of them, and they followed on peaceably after. Then we entered a wood, not like the dark woods we have here, no, no; but light, and all over glorious; the branches of the trees waved to and fro, and we all cried out, “we will dwell safely in the wilderness and sleep in this woods.” We passed through the wood, for we were on our way to Mount Zion. As we were travelling along, we met a company who were also gazing at the glories of the place. I noticed red as a border on their garments; their crowns were brilliant; their robes were pure white. As we greeted them, I asked Jesus who they were? He said they were martyrs that had been slain for him. With them was an innumerable company of little ones; they had a hem of red on their garments also. Mount Zion was just before us, and on the Mount sat a glorious temple, and about it were seven other mountains, on which grew roses and lilies, and I saw the little ones climb, or if they chose, use their little wings and fly to the top of the mountains, and pluck the never fading flowers.

And I saw the fruit of the tree of life, the manna, almonds, figs, pomegranets [sic], grapes, and many other kinds of fruit. We all reclined at the table. I asked Jesus to let me eat of the fruit. He said, not now. Those who eat of the fruit of this land, go back to earth no more. But in a little while, if faithful, you shall both eat of the fruit of the tree of life, and drink of the water of the fountain; and he said, you must go back to the earth again, and relate to others, what I have revealed to you. Then an angel bore me gently down to this dark world. Sometimes I think I cannot stay here any longer, all things of earth look so dreary—I feel very lonely here, for I have seen a better land.

I saw a throne and on it sat the Father and the Son. I gazed on Jesus’ countenance and admired his lovely person. The Father's person I could not behold, for a cloud of glorious light covered him. I asked Jesus if his Father had a form like himself. He said he had, but I could not behold it, for said he if you should once behold the glory of his person you would cease to exist. Before the throne I saw the Advent people, the church, and the world. I saw a company, bowed down before the throne, deeply interested, while the most of them stood up disinterested and careless. Those who were bowed before the throne would offer up their prayers and look to Jesus; then he would look to his Father, and appeared to be pleading with Him. A light would come from the Father to the Son, and from the Son to the praying company. Then I saw an exceeding bright light come from the Father to the Son, and from the Son it waved over the people before the throne. But few would receive this great light; many came out from under it and immediately resisted it; others were careless and did not cherish the light, and it moved off from them; some cherished it, and went and bowed down with the little praying company. This company all received the light, and rejoiced in it, as their countenances shone with its glory. And I saw the Father rise from the throne, and in a flaming Chariot go into the Holy of Holies, within the veil, and did sit. There I saw thrones that I had never seen before. Then Jesus rose up from the throne, and the most of those who were bowed down arose with Him; and I did not see one ray of light pass from Jesus to the careless multitude after he arose, and they were left in perfect darkness. Those who rose up when Jesus did, kept their eyes fixed on Him as He left the throne and led them out a little way.—Then He raised His right arm and we heard his lovely voice saying, “Wait here—I am going to my Father to receive the Kingdom; keep your garments spotless, and in a little while I will return from the wedding and receive you to myself.” And I saw a cloudy chariot, with wheels like flaming fire, and Angels were all around it as it came where Jesus was. He stepped into the chariot and was borne to the Holiest where the Father sat. There I beheld Jesus, as He was standing before the Father, a great High Priest. On the hem of His garment was a bell and pomegranate. Then Jesus shew me the difference between faith and feeling. And I saw those who rose up with Jesus send up their faith to Him in the Holiest, and pray—my Father give us thy Spirit. Then Jesus would breathe upon them the Holy Ghost. In the breath was light, power, and much love, joy and peace. Then I turned to look at the company who were still bowed before the throne; they did not know that Jesus had left it.—Satan appeared to be by the throne, trying to carry on the work of God; I saw them look up to the throne and pray, my Father give us thy Spirit; then Satan would breathe upon them an unholy influence; in it there was light and much power, but no sweet love, joy and peace. Satan's object was to keep them deceived, and to draw back and deceive God's children. I saw one after another leave the company who were praying to Jesus in the Holiest, and go and join those before the throne, and they at once received the unholy influence of Satan."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 106.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

And I saw famine, pestilence and sword—nation rose against nation, and the whole world was in confusion. Then we cried to God day and night for deliverance, until we began to hear the bells on Jesus’ garment. And I saw Jesus rise up in the Holiest, and as he came out we heard the tinkling of the bells and knew that our High Priest was coming out. Then we heard the voice of God which shook the heavens and the earth, and gave the 144,000 the day and hour of Jesus coming. Then the saints were free, united, and full of the glory of God, for he has turned their captivity. And I saw a flaming cloud come where Jesus stood. Then Jesus laid off his priestly garment and put on his Kingly robe, and took his place on the cloud which carried him to the East, where it first appeared to the saints on earth—a small black cloud which was the sign of the Son of Man.

On each end of the ark was a lovely Cherub, with their wings spread out over it. Their faces were turned towards each other, and they looked downwards. Between the angels was a golden censor. Above the ark, where the angels stood, was an exceeding bright glory, that appeared like a throne where God dwelt. Jesus stood by the ark. And as the saints’ prayers came up to Jesus, the incense in the censor would smoke, and He offered up the prayers of the saints with the smoke of the incense to His Father. In the ark, was the golden pot of manna, Aaron's rod that budded and the tables of stone which folded together like a book. Jesus opened them, and I saw the ten commandments4 The connection made here between the Ten Commandments, including the fourth, and the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary affirms Joseph Bates's studies of Revelation 11:19, first published some months earlier in January 1847.\nSee: Joseph Bates, The Seventh Day Sabbath: A Perpetual Sign, 2nd ed., pp. iii, iv. written on them with the finger of God. On one table was four, and on the other six. The four on the first table shone brighter than the other six.

The holy Sabbath looked glorious—a halo of glory was all around it. I saw that the Sabbath was not nailed to the cross. If it was, the other nine commandments were; and we are at liberty to go forth and break them all, as well as to break the fourth.5 This counterargument to the claim that the Sabbath commandment was “nailed to the cross,” together with the arguments that follow regarding the change of the Sabbath, reflect traditional lines of reasoning of the Seventh Day Baptists that were subsequently adopted by early Sabbatarian Adventists such as T. M. Preble and Joseph Bates.\nSee: Merlin Burt, “Sabbatarian Adventism From 1844 to 1849,” pp. 278-281. I saw that God had not changed the Sabbath, for He never changes.

But I saw that it read the same as when written on the tables of stone by the finger of God, and delivered to Moses in Sinai, “But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.” I saw that the holy Sabbath is, and will be, the separating wall between the true Israel of God and unbelievers;7 The vision depicts the composition of “the true Israel of God” as not yet fixed but enlarging as individuals respond positively to the light of the Sabbath truth. “God's chosen” included those “who do not see and keep the Sabbath,” who “had not rejected the light on it,” and who in the future “came out and endured the persecution with us.” and that the Sabbath is the great question, to unite the hearts of God's dear waiting saints. And if one believed, and kept the Sabbath, and received the blessing attending it, and then gave it up, and broke the holy commandment, they would shut the gates of the Holy City against themselves, as sure as there was a God that rules in heaven above. I saw that God had children, who do not see and keep the Sabbath. They had not rejected the light on it. And at the commencement of the time of trouble,8 An examination of A Word to the “Little Flock,” published the following month, shows that James and Ellen White believed in a three-phase “time of trouble”: first, the early time of trouble that began after October 1844, when Jesus began His high-priestly ministry in the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary; second, the time of trouble after the close of human probation, when Jesus leaves the Most Holy Place and the seven last plagues are poured out; third, the time of Jacob's trouble, which occurs before the voice of God delivers His people immediately preceding the Second Coming. Evidently, the time of trouble referred to in this paragraph is the first phase—after 1844 and before probation closes—since God's people “proclaimed the Sabbath more fully.” In the next paragraph Ellen White moved on to describe the events during the great time of trouble after probation closes.\nSee: James White, “The Time of Trouble” and “The Time of Jacob's Trouble,” in A Word to the “Little Flock,” pp. 8-10; EGWEnc, s.v. “Time of Trouble.” we were filled with the Holy Ghost as we went forth, and proclaimed the Sabbath more fully. This enraged the church, and nominal Adventists, as they could not refute the Sabbath truth. And at this time, God's chosen all saw clearly that we had the truth, and they came out and endured the persecution with us.9 Although in earlier vision accounts a radical shut-door stance is denied by implication in several places, this is perhaps the first time that a qualified “open door” position is explicitly asserted. It seems justified to infer from this passage that in the future, persons from mainline churches as well as from non-Sabbatarian Adventist bodies would join the Sabbathkeeping Adventists. For Damsteegt this passage is “the first reference that more specifically described the future mission among non-Adventists.” Poehler, despite some caveats, agrees. “There can be no question that, as Damsteegt has pointed out, this vision ‘contributed significantly to the development of a new theology of mission.’” For a contrasting position, see Lindén, p. 60.\nSee: P. Gerard Damsteegt, Foundations of the Seventh-day Adventist Message and Mission, p. 152; Rolf J. Poehler, “‘… and the Door Was Shut,’” pp. 114, 115; Ingemar Lindén, 1844 and the Shut Door Problem, p. 60. And I saw the sword, famine, pestilence, and great confusion in the land. The wicked thought that we had brought the judgments down on them. They rose up and took counsel to rid the earth of us,10 This section of the vision, dealing with the role of the Sabbath in the end-time persecution of the saints, confirms the conclusions of Joseph Bates's Bible study that he had first published three months earlier in the revised edition of his pamphlet The Seventh Day Sabbath: A Perpetual Sign. However, it should be noted that the core prediction that God's people would undergo violent persecution just prior to the Second Advent had first appeared among future Sabbatarian leaders in Ellen [Harmon] White's earliest vision of December 1844, with further details given in the vision of October 1845 (Lt 1, 1845 [Dec. 20], note 12, and Lt 1, 1846 [Feb. 15], last paragraph). Thus when it comes to this important aspect of Seventh-day Adventist eschatology (the “great controversy” motif) it seems likely that the original impetus for Bates's 1847 pamphlet came from the visions of 1844 and 1845. The same can be said for James White's articles appearing in the seminal pamphlet A Word to the “Little Flock,” published in May 1847. His articles, entitled “The Seven Last Plagues,” “The Voice of God,” “The Time of Trouble,” and “The Time of Jacob's Trouble,” all serve the purpose of examining the biblical case for the predictions of end-time troubles found in the earliest visions. Although it is generally true that in the early development of Seventh-day Adventist doctrine the visions served to confirm prior biblical research, in this case it would seem the opposite was the case.\nSee: Joseph Bates, The Seventh Day Sabbath: A Perpetual Sign, 2nd ed., pp. 58, 59; James White, ed., A Word to the “Little Flock.” For a divergent position on the contribution of Joseph Bates to the origins of the “great controversy” concept, see George Knight, Joseph Bates, pp. 114-117. thinking that then the evil would be stayed."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 115.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

The parenthetical (666) is most likely an explanatory insertion by the publisher, Joseph Bates.

I saw the pious slave rise in triumph and victory, and shake off the chains that bound him, while his wicked master was in confusion, and knew not what to do;13 Millerites and early Adventists often drew parallels of different kinds between the year of jubilee as the climax of the ancient Jewish calendar (Lev. 25) and the climax of earth's history at the coming of Christ and the millennium. Thus, the instruction given that all Hebrew slaves were to be freed in the jubilee year (Lev. 25:10) was seen by William Miller as “typical of the redemption of the people of God from all captivity, bondage, or death into the glorious liberty of the sons of God; Rom. viii.21; and is also typical of the times of the restitution of all things. Acts iii. 21.” Likewise J. H. Waggoner, writing in 1859, saw “the fiftieth year, or jubilee … [when] bondmen went free … [as] typifying the final redemption of God's people … now groaning under the curse.” It is possible that the passage about “the pious slave” in this vision should be given a similar typological interpretation rather than a literal one. Most readers, however, have assumed that the slave statement should be understood literally. Dudley Canright, archcritic of Seventh-day Adventism, classifies it with “other mistakes” that Ellen White made: “In 1849 she foretold what would happen when Jesus came, and said: ‘I saw the pious slave rise.’ But now there are no slaves. She had not then dreamed of the abolition of slavery.” Considerable discussion of this charge has ensued over the years.\nSee: William Miller, A Trilogy, p. 31; D. M.

The voice of the Son of God called forth the sleeping saints, clothed with a glorious immortality. The living saints were changed in a moment, and caught up with them in the cloudy chariot. It looked all over glorious as it rolled upwards. On either side of the chariot were wings, and beneath it wheels. And as the chariot rolled upwards, the wheels cried Holy, and the wings as they moved, cried Holy, and the retinue of Holy Angels around the cloud cried Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty. And the saints in the cloud cried Glory, Hallelujah. And the cloudy chariot rolled upwards to the Holy City. Jesus threw open the gates of the Golden City, and led us in.

Within the next few years, however, Curtis veered toward spiritism, and by 1850 Ellen White declared that she had “no faith in his course.” Beginning in 1851 Eli Curtis published several spiritist papers and tracts containing purported spirit communications. In 1870 a certain “Eli Curtis” bought a property at Mount Nebo, Ohio, for the purpose of forming a spiritualist colony. Whether he was the same Eli Curtis here considered is not known.\nSee: E. G.

Isa. 65:17. 2 Pet. 3:13.) will not appear, till after the wicked dead are raised, and destroyed, at the end of the 1000 years.4 According to mainstream Millerite thinking, events at the beginning of the millennium included the second coming of Christ, the resurrection of the righteous dead, the destruction of the wicked, and the purification of the earth by fire, resulting in “a new heaven and a new earth” (Rev. 21:1). Events at the close of the millennium included the resurrection of the wicked dead, the loosing of Satan, the attempted attack on the Holy City, and the final punitive fires. Gradually, over a period of about five years, Sabbatarian Adventists developed a view of the millennium that differed from the above schema on several key points. The earliest break with the Millerite view is found in Ellen Harmon's first vision of December 1844, in which the saints ascend with Christ to heaven at the Second Coming (see Lt 1, 1845 [Dec. 20], note 16). The next major break appears in this 1847 letter with the assertion that the new heavens and new earth would not emerge at the beginning of the millennium as the Millerites had taught, but at the end, thus anticipating the subsequent teaching that the final fires that destroy Satan and the wicked will also purify the earth, making it “new.” James White claimed, some years later, that his wife's “view of this subject [the millennium] was not till 1850,” his main point being to prove that on this subject, as well as on other unique Sabbatarian teachings, “it should be understood that all these views … were brought out from the Scriptures before Mrs. W. had any view in regard to them.” However, as can be seen from the visions of 1844 and 1847, Ellen White received instruction on important aspects of the emerging new concept of the millennium well before 1850.\nSee: J. W. [James White], “A Test,” Review, Oct. 16, 1855, p. 61. For a summary of William Miller's views on the millennium, see Joshua V. Himes, ed., Views of the Prophecies and Prophetic Chronology, pp. 33-35. The development of Seventh-day Adventist teachings on the millennium are summarized in SDAE, s.v. “Millennium,” and EGWEnc, s.v. “Millennium.” I saw that Satan was “loosed out of his prison,” at the end of the 1000 years, just at the time the wicked dead were raised; and that Satan deceived them by making them believe that they could take the holy city from the saints. The wicked all marched up around the “camp of the saints,” with Satan at their head; and when they were ready to make an effort to take the city, the Almighty breathed from his high throne, on the city, a breath of devouring fire, which came down on them, and burnt them up, “root and branch.”"},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 119.3","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

This went counter to the belief in the immortality of the soul held by William Miller and most mainstream Adventists at the time. The vision, however, affirmed the prior beliefs of Ellen Harmon, who had personally rejected the idea of eternal punishment before she received her first vision (see Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, pp. 39, 40). James White and Joseph Bates shared the same belief prior to 1844, having emerged from the Christian Connection movement, some of whom were annihilationists.\nFor a survey of the divisiveness of the issue of inherent versus conditional immortality within mainstream Adventism of the 1850s, see David Tallmadge Arthur, “‘Come Out of Babylon,’” pp. 201-208; George R. Knight, Millennial Fever, pp. 283-288. Alberto R. Timm discusses the significance of these issues in the context of Seventh-day Adventist doctrinal development in The Sanctuary and the Three Angels’ Messages, pp. 156-162. The Conditionalist Faith of Our Fathers, by LeRoy Edwin Froom, provides a detailed historical survey of conditionalism through the Christian Era. Then will appear the new heaven and the new earth.

Here I must differ with you; for God shew me that this class were professed Adventists, who had fallen away, and “crucified to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.” And in the “hour of temptation,” which is yet to come, to show out every one's true character, they will know that they are forever lost; and overwhelmed with anguish of spirit, they will bow at the saint's feet.6 Revelation 3:9, a message to the church in Philadelphia, which is quoted from here, reads in full: “Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.” Throughout the ages beleaguered Christian minorities suffering at the hands of those they perceived as falsely claiming to be Christians have identified with the sufferings of the church in Philadelphia at the hands of “the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie.” The expression “which say they are Jews, and are not” has been seen as figurative of those who claim to be Christians (“true Jews”) but are not. Thus, for example, the Waldenses, as reported by their enemies, held that “the Romish Church has become a Babel, a Synagogue of Satan; it is the Church of the wicked” (Comba, p. 284; for further historical examples of this kind, see Kovacs, pp. 54-56).\nThe promise given the harassed Philadelphians is that their opponents will “come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee,” with the indication given in the following verse that this will take place in the time of trial and tribulation that precedes Christ's second coming. It is a theme that is further developed in the writings of Ellen White. Speaking of events just before the Second Coming, she wrote, “[Ministers and people] see that they have rebelled against the Author of all just and righteous law. The setting aside of the divine precepts gave rise to thousands of springs of evil. … They realize what they have forfeited by transgression, and they fall at the feet of those whose fidelity they have despised and derided, and confess that God has loved them” (Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, p. 655).\nSee: Emilio Comba, History of the Waldenses of Italy, p. 284; Judith L.

Prominent figure during the 1850s and early 1860s in the emerging “age-to-come” Adventist movement led by Joseph Marsh. From 1847 to 1853 Crosier was assistant editor of Marsh's Advent Harbinger in Rochester, New York. After “age-to-comers” organized a conference in Michigan, Crosier was appointed state evangelist (1858) and conference secretary (1860). Crosier's significance to Seventh-day Adventism lies especially in his groundbreaking Day-Dawn article “To All Who Are Waiting for Redemption” in March 1845, as amplified in “The Law of Moses” in the Day-Star Extra of February 7, 1846. In contrast to the Millerite view that on October 22, 1844, Christ would leave the heavenly sanctuary to execute judgment on earth, Crosier argued that that day marked the beginning of an extended work by Christ in the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary, a paradigm shift that laid the basis for subsequent Seventh-day Adventist sanctuary theology. There is some evidence that Crosier's position built on the insights of Hiram Edson dating back to October 1844. For a time Crosier also kept the Sabbath, but by 1847 he abandoned both the Sabbath and sanctuary doctrines.\nSee: Richard C. Nickels, Six Papers on the History of the Church of God, pp. 117, 118; Merlin D.

Sometime in January 1845 Apollos Hale (c. 1807-after 1882) and Joseph Turner (1807-1862) published the radically different view that the bride represented the New Jerusalem and the coming of the Bridegroom signified the coming of Christ to the Father to receive the kingdom (represented by the New Jerusalem) prior to His return to earth at the Second Coming. A few weeks later, “about the middle of February,” Ellen Harmon was shown in vision a view of the Bridegroom's coming that in some major respects agreed with the position of Hale and Turner.\nSee: A. Hale and J. Turner, “Has Not the Savior Come as the Bridegroom?” Advent Mirror, January 1845, pp. 3, 4; SDAE, s.v. “Apollos Hale,” “Joseph Turner”; EGWEnc, s.v. “Joseph Turner.” as stated in the first published visions. By the letter you would like to know whether I had light on the Bridegroom's coming before I saw it in vision. I can readily answer, No.7 The question here raised by Joseph Bates whether Ellen White had prior knowledge of matters shown her in vision was destined to become a central issue to those concerned with testing or confirming the genuineness of the visions. In some cases, as with the present one, Ellen White's answer was no, she had no previous acquaintance with the matters shown in vision. In other cases she did have prior knowledge, but as she pointed out, this in itself did not negate the genuineness of the vision. “What if you had said ever so much? Would that affect the visions that God gives me? If so, then the visions are nothing. … What you have said, Sister Loveland, influenced me not at all. My opinion has nothing to do with what God has shown me in vision.”\nSee: Ellen G. White, Lt 6, 1851 (Apr. 1). The Lord showed me the travel of the Advent band and midnight cry in December,8 On the significance of the expression “Midnight Cry,” see Lt 1, 1845 (Dec. 20), note 6. but He did not show me the Bridegroom's coming until February following. Perhaps you would like to have me give a statement in relation to both visions. At the time I had the vision of the midnight cry I had given it up in the past and thought it future, as also most of the band had.9 In other words, by December 1844 Ellen Harmon no longer believed that the 2300-day prophecy had ended on October 22, 1844, but that its ending was still future. I know not what time J. Turner [Joseph Turner] got out his paper. I knew he had one out and one was in the house, but I knew not what was in it, for I did not read a word in it.10 It is not clear which paper Ellen White refers to here. The vision under discussion in this part of the letter is the first vision of December 1844, which she appears to have related to the Portland “band” within days of receiving it. The Advent Mirror, which Joseph Turner edited together with A. Hale, contained the groundbreaking article “Has Not the Savior Come as the Bridegroom?” which was in general agreement with the December vision but was not published until January 1845. Another possibility is that the reference is to the Portland-based Hope of Israel. This periodical had begun publication some months earlier and was also coedited by Joseph Turner.\nSee: A. Hale and J. Turner, “Has Not the Savior Come as the Bridegroom?” Advent Mirror, January 1845, pp. 3, 4; “The Hope of Israel,” Advent Herald, Aug. 7, 1844, p. 5. I had been, and still was, very sick. I took no interest in reading, for it injured my head and made me nervous. After I had the vision and God gave me light, He bade me deliver it to the band, but I shrank from it. I was young, and I thought they would not receive it from me. I disobeyed the Lord, and instead of remaining at home, where the meeting was to be that night, I got in a sleigh in the morning and rode three or four miles [six kilometers] and there I found J. T. He merely inquired how I was and if I was in the way of my duty. I said nothing, for I knew I was not. I passed up chamber and did not see him again for two hours, when he came up, asked if I was to be at meeting that night. I told him, no. He said he wanted to hear my vision and thought it duty for me to go home. I told him I should not. He said no more, but went away. I thought, and told those around me, if I went I should have to come out against his views, thinking he believed with the rest.11 That is, she thought Turner had given up the belief that God had led in the proclamation of October 22, 1844.

I felt very, very sad. At length my soul seemed to be in an agony, and while she was talking I fell from my chair to the floor.15 For more on Ellen White's physical posture while in vision, see W. C. White to C. A. Zumwalf, Feb. 24, 1936, and James R. Nix, “Another Look at Israel Damman,” p. 16. It was then I had a view of Jesus rising from His mediatorial throne and going to the holiest as Bridegroom to receive His kingdom.16 For the earliest published accounts of this vision, see: Ellen G. Harmon, “Letter From Sister Harmon,” Day-Star, Mar. 14, 1846 (Lt 1, 1845 [Dec. 20]); idem, “To the Little Remnant Scattered Abroad,” Ms 1, 1846 (Apr. 6).\nEllen White makes the comment a few lines further on that “most of them received the vision,” that is, the vision of the Bridegroom's coming, “and were settled upon the shut door.” The conflating of the two events shows that they were not disparate happenings but closely related. According to the parable of the 10 virgins from which this imagery is taken (Matt. 25), “the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut”; that is, to accept that the Bridegroom had come on October 22, 1844 (see note 6 above) also entailed accepting that the “door” had been “shut” in some sense.\nThose who accepted that a door had been shut in 1844 had disparate views as to what this meant. A survey of the contemporary literature reveals some who held a moderate position on the “shut door,” whereby those consciously rejecting the divinely led “seventh month” preaching in 1844 had sinned against the Holy Spirit. Others held the far more radical position that the door was shut on all non-Millerites on October 22, 1844.\nThe following discussions of early Sabbatarian shut door beliefs—including those of Ellen White—represent a wide range of views: Herbert E. Douglass, Messenger of the Lord, pp. 500-511, 554-569; Ingemar Lindén, 1844 and the Shut Door Problem; Rolf J. Poehler, “‘… and the Door was Shut’”; Gerard P. Damsteegt, Foundations of the Seventh-day Adventist Message and Mission, pp. 149-163; Arthur L. White, “Ellen G. White and the Shut Door Question”; Robert W. Olson, “The ‘Shut Door’ Documents.” For further comment on the rejection motif, see Ms 1, 1849 (Mar. 24), note 13.\nSee also: Introductory article “The ‘Shut Door’ and Ellen White's Visions”; EGWEnc, s.v. “Shut Door.” They were all deeply interested in the view. They all said it was entirely new to them.17 At the time of this meeting, in February 1845, the majority Adventist view rejected the related ideas that the Advent preaching in 1844 was the “midnight cry” of the parable or that the Bridegroom had come or that the door had been shut. The alternative view affirming the prophetic significance of October 22, 1844, the coming of the Bridegroom on that date, etc., was very recent, having first been published by Hale and Turner only a few weeks earlier in January 1845. It is not surprising that Ellen White's vision, broadly affirming the Turner alternative, “was entirely new to them.” The Lord worked in mighty power setting the truth home to their hearts. Sister Durben knew what the power of the Lord was, for she had felt it many times; and a short time after I fell she was struck down and fell to the floor, crying to God to have mercy on her. When I came out of vision, my ears were saluted with Sister Durben's singing and shouting with a loud voice.18 On ecstatic phenomena in early Adventism, see Appendix article “Ellen White and Religious Enthusiasm in Early Adventist Experience”; EGWEnc, s.v. “Ecstatic Experiences.” Most of them received the vision, and were settled upon the shut door. Previous to this I had no light on the coming of the Bridegroom, but had expected Him to this earth to deliver His people on the tenth day of the seventh month. I did not hear a lecture or a word in any way relating to the Bridegroom's going to the holiest. I had but very few privileges in 1842, 1843, & 1844. My sisters both went to the camp meetings in New Hampshire and Maine, while my health prevented me from going to but one, in Maine. I know the light I received came from God, it was not taught me by man. I knew not how to write so that others could read it till God gave me my visions. I went to school but very little on account of my health. I do not think I went to school a day after I was twelve years old, and did not go then but a few days at a time, when sickness would cause me to take [to] my bed for weeks and sometimes for months. The first I wrote anything that could be called writing was after I had been sick [and] the prayer of faith was put up for me, and healing … [Here the sheet ends, and the remainder of the letter is gone.]"},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 129","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

In your letter4 It appears that James White's first contact with Elvira Hastings was in a letter written on May 21, 1847, in which he enclosed “two visions.” One of these “visions” was the broadsheet containing Ellen White's first recorded vision on the Sabbath, published by Joseph Bates a few weeks earlier, in April, at a cost of $7.50 for 1,000 copies. White indirectly solicited a contribution to help cover the printing costs. The other “vision” sent by White was probably the broadside “To the Little Remnant Scattered Abroad,” which had been published in April the previous year, 1846. Elvira Hastings replied to White a few days later, on May 28, enclosing a $1.00 contribution and also raising the theological question on the “voice of God.”\nSee: James White to Elvira Hastings, May 21, 1847; James White to Elvira Hastings, Aug. 22, 1847; Ellen G.

For further comments on this prediction, see Lt 1, 1845 (Dec. 20), note 8.

However, during the autumn of 1848, shortly before Ellen White's vision, Cook renounced his position on the Sabbath in the course of several articles written for the Advent Harbinger. He concluded his article of September 30, 1848, with the words “While the Sabbatic law is thus relaxed, every other precept of the Decalogue is enforced and embodied in the law of Christ!!” It is likely that the question “who has relaxed that fourth commandment?” relates to Cook's statement in the September 30 Harbinger.\nSee: J.B.C.

Bates introduction:] A small company of brethren and sisters were assembled in meeting in Dorchester, near Boston, Mass. Before the meeting commenced, some of us were examining some of the points in the sealing message; some difference of opinion existed about the correctness of the view of the word ascending, &c,3 The first four verses of Revelation 7 dealing with the seal of God had come under special scrutiny by Sabbatarian Adventists in 1848:\n1. And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.\n2. And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,\n3. Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.\n4. And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and they were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.\nA letter from Joseph Bates dated August 7, 1848, is the first extant source that proposes that the seal of God in this passage is related to the Sabbath. While Bates's interpretation on this central point seems shortly to have gained broad acceptance among Sabbatarian Adventists, there was disagreement on his interpretation of some other features of the passage. Two points of contention were:\n1. Whether the angel in verse 2 should be understood literally or symbolically. Bates originally believed the angel “ascending from the east” symbolized Adventist preachers of the Sabbath. That they ascended “from the east” (literally “from the rising of the sun”) was taken as corresponding with the fact that they started their proclamation on the East Coast of the United States, later spreading westward. Bates subsequently changed his view, now holding that the angel in verse 2 was literal and modifying his earlier position that “ascending from the east” primarily had a geographical meaning. He attributed his change to this vision that focuses on the manner in which the Sabbath message arose rather than on its location. Like the ascending sun the message gradually increased in strength and glory. (Note expressions such as “Like the sun, first cold, grows warmer and sends its rays.”)\n2. How to interpret the four angels holding the four winds (verse 1). Bates initially followed other Adventist expositors in taking the four angels to mean national powers. Thus Joseph Turner, editor of The Bible Advocate, held that the four angels were the main signatories to the peace treaties at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 after the Napoleonic wars, powers that thereby had the might to hold back the winds of war. Bates's interpretation was a little different, as he included the United States together with the main European powers.\nAfter meeting the objections of “many of those observing the Sabbath,” Bates changed his position here also. In May 1849 he published a retraction, holding that “the four messengers [angels], instead of being the four principal governments of earth, are FOUR LITERAL ANGELS commissioned by God to execute His purpose in the destruction of the wicked.”\nSee: Joseph Bates to Brother and Sister Hastings, Aug. 7, 1848; [J. Turner], “The Loosing of the Four Winds,” Bible Advocate, June 15, 1849, p. 132; Joseph Bates, A Seal of the Living God, pp. 4, 24; “Not So,” Review, Dec. 23, 1851, p. 72. For a detailed historical and theological study of “the sealing message” as it developed in 1848 and 1849, see Merlin Burt, “Sabbatarian Adventism From 1844 to 1849,” pp. 360-380. and whereas we had made the publishing of the message a subject of prayer at the Topsham Conference (Me.) a little previous,4 October 20-22, 1848. See James White to Leonard and Elvira Hastings, Oct. 2, 1848. and the way to publish appeared not sufficiently clear, we therefore resolved unitedly to refer it all to God.

The January vision uses the expression “time of trouble” in the context of Daniel 12:1: “At that time shall Michael stand up … : and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was.” This verse was understood as indicating that a time of trouble would occur immediately after the close of Christ's intercession. In the November vision, however, the time of trouble has already started but the standing up of Michael is still future: “That time has not yet come … but will come when Michael stands up.” Clearly, a time of trouble that commences before Michael stands up cannot refer to the same time of trouble found in Daniel 12:1, which commences after Michael stands up.\nIt is interesting that Ellen White's visions on this issue went counter to the views of the senior voice of Sabbatarian Adventism at that time, Joseph Bates. In his book A Seal of the Living God, published some weeks later (January 1849) Bates, impressed with the current revolutionary fervor in Europe, insisted that “the time of trouble such as never was, Dan. xii:1 has began [sic]” (emphasis Bates's).\nSee: Ellen G.

Several noted astronomers had reported “openings” in the Great Nebula in Orion, a fact seen by subsequent Adventist writers as confirming Ellen White's vision. Thus, Christian Huygens, in the seventeenth century, interpreted certain dark areas of the nebula as “an opening in the sky.” Likewise, most nineteenth-century astronomers interpreted starless, dark portions of the Orion Nebula as “tubes through which we may look into the remotest depths of space” (Alexander von Humboldt, in Sprengel and Martz, Review, Apr. 1, 1976, p. 10). However, by the early twentieth century “these blank areas in the sky were discovered to be opaque clouds of dust and gas situated between the earth and the most distant stars” (ibid.), not openings leading to the depths of space. These later scientific discoveries do not, of course, disprove the description given in the vision that the new Jerusalem pictured by John as “coming down from God out of heaven” (Rev. 21:2) will make its entrance into our galaxy and view by way of the constellation Orion.\nThe best historical survey of the intersection of science and theology as regards Ellen White's Orion vision is found in Merton E. Sprengel and Dowell E. Martz, “Orion Revisited,” Review, Mar. 25, 1976, pp. 4-7; idem, “How Open Is Orion's Open Space?” Review, Apr. 1, 1976, pp. 9-11; idem, “Does the ‘Open Space’ Exist Today?” Review, Apr. 8, 1976, pp. 6-8. from whence came the voice of God. I saw that the Holy City will come down through that open space. I saw that the powers of earth are now being shaken. The Lord showed me that things came in order—war, and rumors of war—sword, famine, and pestilence are first to shake the powers of earth, then the voice of God will shake the heavens and earth—the sun, moon, and stars and this planet also. I saw that the shaking of nations in Europe is not the shaking of the powers of heaven as some teach, but it is the shaking of the powers of earth.2 The last sentence provides a key to understanding this document. Some Adventists interpreted the revolutionary ferment sweeping through Europe in 1848 in which a string of monarchs were overthrown as fulfilling Christ's prediction in Luke 21:26 that “the powers of heaven shall be shaken.” They also noted that this event is the last of the signs enumerated by Christ in this passage before the coming of the Son of man: “And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming upon the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. And then they shall see the Son of man coming” (verses 25-27). Thus D. Crary wrote in the Adventist Bible Advocate of the 1848 events as “this sweeping tornado, which like an electric shock, has passed over Europe” and concludes that this is the event “which the Saviour gave as the last sign of his coming, ‘The powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.’” The extent to which Sabbatarian Adventists shared this interpretation is not known, but the fact that the vision contradicts it suggests that it was an issue among them, also.\nThe obvious difficulty with this interpretation is that it is hard to see why European powers in 1848 should be described as “the powers that are in heaven.” Some Advocate articles and letters argued that “the powers of heaven” simply meant “the powers and kingdoms of this world,” whereas others held that the two are clearly distinguished in the Bible. For J. B. Cook “the heaven” is as distinct from “the earth” in the Bible “as the Creator is from the creature.” We should not “confound heaven and earth!”\nThe debate over the meaning of “heaven” and “earth” in the Bible and over Christ's expression “the shaking of the powers of heaven” in the context of the 1848 revolutions clearly provides the context for Ellen White's statements in this vision. Thus the opening sentences seek to define these terms, and the last sentence concludes that “the shaking of the powers of heaven” applies not to the current crisis in Europe but to future events, when “the voice of God will shake the heavens and earth—the sun, moon, and stars and this planet also.”\nSee: D. Crary, “The Powers That Are in Heaven Shall Be Shaken,” Bible Advocate, June 1, 1848, p. 116; H. L. Smith, “The Powers of Heaven Shall Be Shaken,” Bible Advocate, June 8, 1848, pp. 123, 124; H. H.

Almost two years earlier Ellen White had indicated that God's “chosen” included those “who do not see and keep the Sabbath. They had not rejected the light on it,” and in the future “they came out and endured the persecution with us.”\nSee: Ellen G. White, Lt 1, 1847 (Apr. 7); introductory article “The ‘Shut Door’ and Ellen White's Visions”; EGWEnc, s.v. “Shut Door.” On the bottom of His garment was a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate.2 Ex. 28:34. Then I saw that Jesus would not leave the most holy place until every case was decided, either for salvation or destruction. I saw that the wrath of God3 See: EGWEnc, s.v. “Wrath of God.” could not come until Jesus had finished His work in the most holy place, laid off His priestly attire, and clothed Himself with the garments of vengeance. Then Jesus will step out from between the Father and man, and God will keep silent no longer, but pour out His wrath on those who have rejected His truth. I saw that the anger of the nations, the wrath of God, and the time to judge the dead, were separate events, one following the other. I saw that Michael4 See: SDAE, s.v. “Michael, the Archangel”; Questions on Doctrine, pp. 65-76. had not stood up, and that the time of trouble,5 See: EGWEnc, s.v. “Time of Trouble.” such as never was, had not yet commenced. I saw that the nations are now getting angry, but when our High Priest has finished His work in the sanctuary, then He will stand up, put on the garments of vengeance, and then will the seven last plagues6 See: EGWEnc, s.v. “Plagues, Seven Last.” be poured out.7 This vision focuses on the interpretation and fulfillment of certain biblical passages dealing with end-time events. The first paragraph centers on Revelation 11:18, Revelation 15:1, and Daniel 12:1:\n• Rev. 11:18—“And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged.”\n• Rev. 15:1—“And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.”\nSome 18 months earlier James White, referring to Revelation 15:1, had argued that the “wrath of God … is contained in the plagues” and would be poured out “in the future” (A Word to the “Little Flock,” p. 1). (He had also placed the “time of trouble” of Daniel 12:1 and the releasing of the “four winds” in the future.) By January 1849, however, Joseph Bates had published his conviction that the wrath of God was already beginning to be manifest in the events of Europe in 1848:\n• “See the account from the Boston Times of Oct. 26, 1848, of the flight of the Emperor of Austria from VIENNA. … See also a similar state of things in Berlin. … Almost every arrival from Europe shows that these difficulties instead of being settled are breaking out like volcanic eruptions. … Well, say the thoughtless ones, these things are nothing more than what has been before. I reply … isolated revolutions are trivial, when compared as it were with continental Europe. There things without any doubt are in their progress and order the fulfillment of prophecy, viz: ‘The nations are angry, thy wrath has come.’ Rev. xi:18” (A Seal of the Living God, p. 48).\nJoseph Bates was not the only one who was stirred by the revolutionary events of 1848 into thinking that the “wrath of God” and the final events had begun, but his voice was especially significant. Bates's biographer George Knight calls him the “acknowledged leader” of the Sabbatarian Adventists until 1849.\nClearly, this vision of January 5, 1849, placed the “wrath of God” as still future, challenging the position taken by Bates in his tract A Seal of the Living God, published the same month. It also challenged Bates on his interpretation of Daniel 12:1:\n• “And at that time shall Michael stand up … : and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was … : and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.”\nAgain Bates was convinced by the events of 1848 that the “time of trouble, such as never was” had begun: “The time of trouble such as never was,” Dan. xii:1, has began [sic]” whereas according to the vision “the time of trouble, such as never was, had not commenced.”\nSee: James White, ed., A Word to the “Little Flock,” pp. 1, 8, 3; Joseph Bates, A Seal of the Living God, pp. 48, 46; George R.

Mention of an interpreting angel is found already in the account of her first vision. Various designations are employed in her writings, such as “attending angel” (first found in this document), “accompanying angel,” and “guide.” In an article from 1875 Ellen White related that the “same person has appeared before me in important dreams to instruct me from time to time during the past twenty-six years.”\nSee: Ellen G. Harmon, Lt 1, 1845 (Dec. 20); Ellen G. White, “A Remarkable Dream,” Review, Nov. 4, 1875, p. 139. For further examples of angelic guidance while in vision, see Ellen G. White, The Truth About Angels, pp. 252-257. directed me to the City again where I saw four angels winging their way to the gate of the City, and were just presenting the golden card12 One other mention is made in Ellen White's writings of these “golden cards”: “All the angels that are commissioned to visit the earth hold a golden card, which they present to the angels at the gates of the city as they pass in and out” (Ms 4, 1849 [Jan. 31]). The question arises, Why would such a system be necessary for heavenly angels? The passage must be read in the context of its previous sentence: “I will here state, that there is perfect order and harmony in the holy city.” Thus, the “golden cards” apparently relate to the “perfect order” of heaven rather than to some sort of security procedure.\nA related question is whether the presentation of cards by the angels should be understood literally. Not enough information is given for a definitive answer, but in this same vision an angel is seen “waving something up and down in his hand,” which is identified in a different vision on the same Sabbath as the “seal of God” (cf. Rev. 7:2). As a literal seal is not to be impressed upon the foreheads of the redeemed, it suggests the possibility that Ellen White's view of angels presenting “golden cards” may also be a visual way of communicating that the city is administered with “perfect order and harmony.”\nSee: Ellen G. White, Ms 4, 1849, “To Those Who Are Receiving the Seal of the Living God,” broadside, Jan. 31, 1849. to the angel at the gate. Then I saw another angel swiftly flying from the direction of the most excellent glory; and crying with a loud voice to the other four angels and waving something up and down in his hand.

The whole question of informed as opposed to rash sacrifice should be seen in the context of certain radical voices within the young movement. Most influential was that of Joseph Bates, who, in a tract published the same month, January 1849, urged members to sell their properties and not to delay with the hope that prices would rise. Bates had followed that same stern path himself. James White wrote of Bates that he once “had some eight or ten thousand dollars … [but] has spent all his property in the Holy Advent cause.” The uncompromising stand taken by Bates in the 1849 tract was probably influenced by his conviction at the time that the contemporary revolutionary events in Europe constituted the beginning of the time of trouble spoken of in Daniel 12:1. Nevertheless, Bates's radical message, according to Ellen White, caused considerable problems in western New York, where poor members sometimes demanded that wealthier members sell their property in order to help support them. James White, writing in January 1850, held that “there has been means enough squandered away, and worse than lost in W. New York, the last nine months to support the paper [Present Truth] six months or a year.”\nSee: Joseph Bates, A Seal of the Living God, pp. 68, 69; Ellen G.

These plagues enraged the wicked against the righteous, and they thought that we had brought them down upon them, and if they could rid the earth of us, then the plagues would be stayed. A decree went forth to slay the saints, which caused them to cry day and night for deliverance. This was the time of Jacob's trouble. Then all the saints cried out with anguish of spirit, and were delivered by the Voice of God. Then the 144,000 triumphed. Their faces were lighted up with the glory of God. Then I was shown a company who were howling in agony. On their garments was written in large characters—thou art weighed in the balance, and found wanting. I asked who this company were. The angel said, “these are they who have once kept the Sabbath and have given it up.” I heard them cry with a loud voice—“we have believed in thy coming, and taught it with energy.” And while they were speaking, their eyes would fall upon their garments and see the writing, and then they would wail aloud. I saw they had drunk of the deep waters, and fouled the residue with their feet—trodden the Sabbath underfoot, and that is why they were weighed in the balance and found wanting. Then my attending angel directed me to the city again, where I saw four angels winging their way to the gate of the city, and were just presenting the golden card to the angel at the gate. Then I saw another angel swiftly flying from the direction of the most excellent glory, and crying with a loud voice to the other angels, and waving something up and down in his hand. I asked my attending angel for an explanation of what I saw. He told me that I could see no more then, but he would shortly show me what those things that I then saw meant."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 148.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

We all united in applying to the Physician who never lost a case, and while healing power came down, and the sick was healed, the Spirit fell upon me and I was taken off in vision. I saw the state of some who stood on present truth, but disregarded the visions,—the way God had chosen to teach in some cases, those who erred from Bible truth. I saw that in striking against the visions they did not strike against the worm—the feeble instrument that God spake through; but against the Holy Ghost. I saw it was a small thing to speak against the instrument, but it was dangerous to slight the words of God. I saw if they were in error and God chose to show them their errors through visions, and they disregarded the teachings of God through visions, they would be left to take their own way, and run in the way of error, and think they were right, until they would find it out too late. Then in the time of trouble I heard them cry to God in agony—“Why didst thou not show us our wrong, that we might have got right and been ready for this time?” Then an angel pointed to them and said—“My Father taught, but you would not be taught.—He spoke through visions, but you disregarded his voice, and he gave you up to your own ways, to be filled with your own doings.” Then I saw four angels who had a work to do on the earth, and were on their way to accomplish it. Jesus was clothed with Priestly garments. He gazed in pity on the remnant, then raised his hands upward, and with a voice of deep pity cried—“MY BLOOD, FATHER, MY BLOOD, MY BLOOD, MY BLOOD.” Then I saw an exceeding bright light come from God, who sat upon the great white throne, and was shed all about Jesus. Then I saw an angel with a commission from Jesus, swiftly flying to the four angels who had a work to do on the earth, and waving something up and down in his hand, and crying with a loud voice—“HOLD! HOLD! HOLD! HOLD! until the servants of God are sealed in their foreheads.”—I asked my accompanying angel the meaning of what I heard, and what the four angels were about to do. He said to me that it was God that restrained the powers, and that he gave his angels charge over things on the earth, and that the four angels had power from God to hold the four winds, and that they were about to let the four winds go, and while they had started on their mission to let them go, the merciful eye of Jesus gazed on the remnant that were not all sealed, then he raised his hands to the Father and plead with him that he had spilled his blood for them.

Joseph Bates, a former sea captain, was present and apparently was the one who identified specific planets based on her descriptions. (There is no record of Ellen White's identifying the “worlds” she was shown in vision.) It is not certain whether the view here described is the same 1846 vision or a different one. That she had more than one view of “other worlds” may be inferred from her description of the 1846 vision as being “the first time” that she “had a view of other planets.”\nSee: James White, ed., A Word to the “Little Flock,” p. 22; Ellen G. White, Spiritual Gifts [vol. 2], p. 83. For a discussion of the question of which “worlds” Ellen White saw in vision, see F. D. Nichol, Ellen G. White and Her Critics, pp. 91-101. Wings were given me, and an angel attended me from the city to a place that was bright and glorious. The grass of the place was living green, and the birds there warbled a sweet song. The inhabitants of the place were of all sizes, they were noble, majestic and lovely. They bore the express image of Jesus, and their countenances beamed with holy joy, expressive of the freedom and happiness of the place. I asked one of them why they were so much more lovely than those on the earth. The reply was—“we have lived in strict obedience to the commandments of God, and have not fallen by disobedience, like those on the earth.” Then I saw two trees, one looked much like the tree of life in the city. The fruit of both looked beautiful; but of one they could not eat. They had power to eat of both, but were forbidden to eat of one. Then my attending angel said to me—“none in this place have tasted of the forbidden tree; but if they should eat they would fall.” Then I was taken to a world which had seven moons. There I saw good old Enoch, who had been translated. On his right arm he bore a glorious palm, and on each leaf was written Victory. Around his head was a dazzling white wreath, and leaves on the wreath, and in the middle of each was written Purity; and around the leaf were stones of various colors, that shone brighter than the stars, and cast a reflection upon the letters, and magnified them. On the back part of his head was a bow that confined the wreath, and upon the bow was written Holiness. Above the wreath was a lovely crown that shone brighter than the sun. I asked him if this was the place he was taken to from the earth. He said, “It is not; but the city is my home, and I have come to visit this place.” He moved about the place as if perfectly at home. I begged of my attending angel to let me remain in that place. I could not bear the thought of coming back to this dark world again. Then the angel said—“you must go back, and if you are faithful, you, with the 144,000 shall have the privilege of visiting all the worlds and viewing the handy work of God.”"},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 151.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

I saw that if the saints have food laid up by them, or in the fields, in the time of trouble when sword, famine, and pestilence are in the land, it will be taken from them by violent hands and strangers would reap their fields. Then will be the time for us to trust wholly in God, and he will sustain us. I saw that our bread and water would be sure at that time, and we should not lack, or suffer hunger.—The Lord has shown me that some of his children would fear when they see the price of food rising, and they would buy food and lay it by for the time of trouble. Then in a time of need, I saw them go to their food and look at it, and it had bred worms, and was full of living creatures, and not fit for use. About one week since, the Lord showed me in vision, that houses and lands would be of no use in the time of trouble, and in that time they could not be disposed of. I saw it was the will of God that the saints should cut loose from every encumbrance—dispose of their houses and lands before the time of trouble comes, and make a covenant with God by sacrifice.

I heard them mourn like this,—the cause was languishing—God's people were suffering for truth, and we made no effort to supply the lack, and now our property is useless. Oh! that we had let it go, and laid up treasure in heaven. I saw a sacrifice did not increase, but decrease, and was consumed. I also saw that God had not required all of his people to dispose of their property at the same time, but in a time of need he would teach them, if they desired to be taught, when to sell and how much to sell.

Those only who have clean hands and a pure heart will stand that trying time. Now is the time for the law of God to be in our minds (foreheads), and written in our hearts. The Lord has shown me the danger of letting our minds be filled with worldly thoughts and cares. I saw that some minds were led away from present truth and a love of the holy Bible, by reading other exciting books; and others were filled with perplexity and care for what they shall eat, drink and wear. I saw some, looking too far off for the coming of the Lord. Time has continued on a few years longer than they expected, therefore they think it may continue a few years more, and in this way their minds are being led from present truth, out after the world. In these things I saw great danger; for if the mind is filled with other things, present truth is shut out, and there is no place in our foreheads for the seal of the living God. This seal is the Sabbath. I saw that the time for Jesus to be in the most holy place was nearly finished, and that time can last but a very little longer; and what leisure time we have should be spent in searching the Bible, which is to judge us in the last day.8 In 1883 Ellen White addressed the “time” question raised by these and other statements. After quoting several scriptural examples (1 Cor. 7:29, 30; Rom. 13:12; Rev. 1:3; 22:6, 7), she wrote: “The angels of God in their messages to men represent time as very short. Thus it has always been presented to me. It is true that time has continued longer than we expected in the early days of this message. Our Saviour did not appear as soon as we hoped.

This vision of March 1849, however, in addition to confirming earlier study and revelation, is of interest since for the first time the imagery of Revelation 3:7 (“he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth; … behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it”) is used to describe Christ's transition in 1844 from the holy place to the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary.

After their first public demonstrations of spirit communication in Rochester, New York, in November 1849, public interest grew very rapidly. Many who became Spiritualists broke with their churches. Probably the most high-profile casualty from Seventh-day Adventist ranks to the Spiritualists was Moses Hull, a minister and writer who defected in 1863.\nSee: Bret E. Carroll, Spiritualism in Antebellum America, pp. 46-62; SDAE, s.v. “Moses Hull”; James R. Nix, “The Life and Work of Moses Hull”; EGWEnc, s.v. “Moses Hull,” “Spiritualism.” I saw that Satan was working through agents in a number of ways. He was at work through ministers who had rejected God's truth, and had been given over to strong delusions to believe a lie that they might be damned.7 Paraphrase of 2 Thess. 2:11, 12: “And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: That they all might be damned who believe not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.” While they are preaching or praying some would fall prostrate and helpless; not by the power of the Holy Ghost, no, no; but by the power of Satan breathed on these agents and through them to the people."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 162.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

One or two specific names of Adventist ministers thought to be involved in mesmerism are mentioned in contemporary Sabbatarian sources. According to J. N. Andrews, a certain P. A. Smith claimed that he “could heal people by Mesmerism, and do other wonders.” Joseph Turner, prominent Millerite Adventist minister and editor, was identified by both Ellen White and Joseph Bates as being involved with mesmerism. In one of the more vivid passages of her 1860 autobiography Ellen White recalled a meeting in 1845 at which Turner “had his hand up to his face, and was looking through his fingers, his eyes intently fixed on me.” In 1848 Bates charged Turner with using his “mesmeric influence” on “some of the dear sisters” and suggested that mesmerism was involved in Turner's revival meetings in New Bedford, Massachusetts, charges that were subsequently angrily rejected by Turner.\nSee: J. N. Andrews, “Reply to Mary A. Seymour,” Review, Mar. 2, 1852, p. 102; Ellen G.

I saw that these men had made God altogether such a one as themselves and valued His power as a thing of naught. I saw that some of these agents of the devil were affecting the bodies of those that they could not deceive and draw from the present truth.9 For a discussion of the expression “present truth,” see Alberto R. Timm, The Sanctuary and the Three Angels’ Messages, pp. 115, 116, 122-129, 243-252; EGWEnc, s.v. “Present Truth.” Some of these were even trying to affect some of the saints unto death.10 Further light is thrown on this somewhat obscure passage in Ms 7, 1849, dated just a few weeks earlier, concerning Elvira Hastings. In a vision Ellen White was shown a certain unnamed person whom “Satan used … as an agent to affect and afflict Sister Hastings” “unto death.” The closeness in the language of the two passages and the proximity in time between them clearly suggest that Elvira Hastings was one of those referred to in this passage as being affected by an agent of Satan. See note 5 in Ms 7, 1849 (Mar. 11), for further discussion regarding the possible identification of the “agent” affecting Elvira Hastings.

The reformations that were shown me were not reformations from error to truth; no, no; but from bad to worse, for those who professed a change of heart had only wrapped about them a religious garb which covered up the iniquity of a vile heart. Some appeared to have been really converted so as to deceive God's people. But if their hearts could be seen they would appear as black as ever.12 For a study of early Sabbatarian Adventists’ attitudes to religious revivals, see P. Gerard Damsteegt, Foundations of the Seventh-day Adventist Message and Mission, pp. 184-186. My accompanying angel bade me to look for the travail of soul for sinners as used to be. I looked, but could not see it, for the time of their salvation is passed.13 Some have interpreted the phrase “the time of their salvation is passed” to refer to the “sinners” in the previous sentence and concluded that the vision takes the radical position that there can be no more conversions (Canright, Lindén). That this conclusion is not necessary has been argued by others mainly on two grounds:\n• An equally plausible reading of this manuscript is that the statement “the time of their salvation is passed” refers specifically to those mentioned earlier who had “rejected God's truth” and “rejected present truth” (Nichol). Ellen White herself, in a comment made in 1854, explains that this expression “relates more particularly to those who have heard and rejected the light of the Advent doctrine.”\n• Even if “the time of their salvation is passed” does refer to “sinners,” it has been argued that the word “sinners” is used by Ellen White and other contemporary Sabbatarian Adventists in the restricted sense of those who had willfully rejected the gospel and/or the Advent message. They recognized that there were “honest souls” who were not guilty of willful rejection and who would yet take their stand with God's people (Poehler).\nSee: D. M.

Stowell Crawford, “A Letter From a Veteran Worker,” Southern Watchman, Apr. 25, 1905, p. 278. We spent one week with them. Our meetings were very interesting. They were hungry for present truth. We had free, powerful meetings with them. God gave me two visions while there, much to the comfort and strength of the brethren and sisters.

Found a Sister Goram [the spelling disparity is probably not significant], took dinner, and then walked five miles [eight kilometers] to Bro.

Paragraph 5 reveals that the Whites had already visited the Hastings family (“I have not forgotten the good seasons we had together”), whereas Leonard Hastings later recalled that “Bro. and sister White made us their first visit in March, 1849” (Ellen G.

In addition, James White is said to have returned recently from “western N.Y.” (par. 1), whereas other evidence strongly suggests that James's first visit to western New York was together with Ellen some months later, in August 1848 (James White to Hastings, Aug. 26, 1848). Another anomaly is that the second part of the letter is headed “June 1, Friday” when, in fact, June 1 fell on a Thursday in 1848. June 1 did, however, fall on a Friday in 1849, and this circumstance, together with the testimony of Leonard Hastings, suggests that the letter was actually written in 1849. A closer examination of the handwritten original date “May 29, 1848,” reveals that the ink strokes of the “1848” are much lighter and fainter than the “May 29,” suggesting—though clearly not demanding—that the year “1848” might have been added at a later time, with the original bearing only the month and day of “May 29.” The balance of evidence, it seems, favors the conclusion that the letter was written on May 29, 1849."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 171.3","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Two months earlier they had experienced “much perplexity and trial,” not knowing whether to spend the summer in New York, Connecticut, or Massachusetts, before they felt impressed that they should go to Connecticut.\nSee: James White to Leonard and Elivira Hastings, Feb. 25, 1849; James White to “Beloved Brother and Sister,” Mar. 22, 1849, Ellen G.

H. as soon as June” at which James White and Joseph Bates would lead out. A reference in Spiritual Gifts to a journey by James White to New Hampshire and Maine about June 1849 seems to confirm that the conference took place. Ellen White, only a few weeks away from giving birth to Edson (July 28), did not accompany her husband.\nSee: James White to “Beloved Friends,” postscript to Lt 5, 1849 (Apr. 21); Ellen G. White, Spiritual Gifts [vol. 2], p. 113. and that a conference should be holden in Paris, Maine, and souls would be strengthened and comforted there.7 Whereas James White had planned for a conference in Paris, Maine, in June 1849, it appears to have been postponed till September. Ellen White recalled in her memoirs that the Paris group “had not had a meeting for one year and a half” at the time when the conference opened on September 14. The prediction that “souls would be strengthened and comforted there” was strikingly fulfilled, as related in Spiritual Gifts. In particular the conference marked the emergence of 20-year-old J. N. Andrews to a lifetime of ministry and scholarship for the young movement.\nSee: James White to “Beloved Friends,” postscript to Lt 5, 1849 (Apr. 21); Ellen G.

During this period Edson was born on July 28 and James White started the publication of The Present Truth. However, by September, when Edson was 6 weeks old, their travels started again, first to conferences in Vermont and Maine, and later in the autumn to western New York. By December 1849 they had settled in Oswego, New York. For an overview of the travels and work of the Whites during 1849, see Arthur L. White, Ellen G.

I also saw that God was displeased when we trusted in or called on earthly physicians.18 Ellen White did not understand the affirmation of faith healing found here to exclude the use of simple remedies. For example, the previous summer, when the Whites feared that their infant son, Henry, “would die with consumption,” they “used simple herbs,” and other medicines, “but they had no effect.” It was after these failed that the Whites anointed Henry, who subsequently recovered. This relationship between the use of remedies and prayer for healing was confirmed by vision in 1853: “I saw that it was right to use herbs that are beneficial to the use of man” (Lt 11, 1853 [Dec. 3]).\nIf the use of remedies per se is not the issue, the question remains why “earthly physicians” should not be consulted. Even though the vision is not explicit on this point, it seems natural to suggest that the problem lay in the dangerous nature of many of the “remedies” so common in mid-nineteenth-century medical practice. In the light of her other counsels, including those in regard to Christian physicians, this statement may also be understood as a warning not to put one's whole trust for healing in human instrumentalities, but to keep God in the equation.\nSee: Ellen G.

Not only is the accuracy of the recorder's transcription not guaranteed, but the intermittent character of the utterances means that there is often insufficient context available to make the meaning of individual statements clear or to understand the overall structure of the vision. In the case at hand, Ms 6, 1849, certain themes appear—the shortness of time, the need to spread the message, appeals for unity and self-sacrifice—but we cannot be sure how these elements fit into the overall message.

The identity is confirmed by the fact that the meeting at which this vision was received took place in Rocky Hill, just a few miles from E.L.H. Chamberlain's home town of Middletown.

Two days later he wrote, “The cry from the holy City is speed the messengers, speed the messengers, the work is almost done. … The vision says spare neither money nor anything to do the work now. Soon it will be forever to [sic] late.” Ellen White was later accused of being a false prophet. In 1883 she responded: “The angels of God in their messages to men represent time as very short. Thus it has always been presented to me. It is true that time has continued longer than we expected in the early days of this message. … But has the word of the Lord failed? Never!

Souls are coming into the truth4 Sabbatarian Adventism in western New York, where the Whites were located at this time, was experiencing remarkable growth. Writing some weeks earlier, James White enthusiastically reported that “in Western N.Y. the number of Sabbath keepers is increasing fast. There are more than twice the number now than six months ago.” Not only was there numerical increase, but some of it was coming from outside the ranks of Adventists. In a letter written the following month, Ellen White noted that some of those “coming out upon the truth” “have not heard the Advent doctrine.”\nSee: James White to “Brother Bowles,” Nov. 8, 1849; Ellen G. White, Lt 4, 1850 (Feb. 18). and soon the work will be all done. Keep up good courage, hope in God, let nothing weigh thee down. We have the truth. We know it. Praise the Lord. I saw yesterday our work was not to the shepherds who have rejected the former messages,5 The charge made here is that the first-day Adventist ministers (“shepherds”) had rejected the first two angels’ messages, which, prior to 1844, had been central to their very identity. As James White expressed it, these Adventists now refused “to acknowledge that the great leading movements in our past experience, such as the proclamation of 1843, the fall of the churches or Babylon, and the midnight cry in 1844, were the work of God, and a perfect fulfilment of his pure word.” Instead, they considered these movements “‘a mistake,’ the ‘work of men,’ ‘mesmerism,’ and ‘of the Devil.’”\nSee: “The Third Angel's Message,” Present Truth, April 1850, p. 65; EGWEnc, s.v. “Three Angels’ Messages.” but to the honest deceived who are led astray.

In part it was a problem of maintaining unity of teaching and doctrine but also the financial problem of unsuitable “messengers” absorbing scarce donations for travel while legitimate preachers were sometimes unable to travel for lack of funds. The whole issue had been raised by Ellen and James White as early as 1848. According to John Loughborough a partial solution was found in 1853 by issuing approved preachers a card “simply stating that they were approved in the work of the gospel ministry … signed by two of the leading ministers.” A full resolution to the problem would not come until the organization of the early 1860s.\nSee: Joseph Bates to Brother and Sister Hastings, Aug. 7, 1848; James White to Brother and Sister Collins, Sept. 8, 1849; J.

Although financial contributions from readers had at first more than covered costs, by the end of the year the periodical was in debt. Further, his close coworker, Joseph Bates, opposed the whole project; “Brother Bates discouraged me about the paper and I gave it up forever.” The turning point that turned James White from his discouragement was Ellen White's vision of January 9, 1850. He wrote on January 10: “Last night we had a wonderful, powerful time here at Brother B. C. Stoors. … Ellen had the following view in relation to the ‘Present Truth.’ I [Ellen] saw the paper, and that it was needed. … I saw that God did not want James to stop yet; but he must write, write, write, write, and speed the message and let it go.”\nSee: Ellen G.

In late November or December 1849 they settled in Oswego, New York. “We rented a house in Oswego, and borrowed articles from our brethren, and commenced house-keeping.”\nSee: Ellen G. White, Spiritual Gifts [vol. 2], pp. 116-122. I could not get time to answer any letters and it took all James’ time to write for the paper and get out the hymn book.6 Hymns, for God's Peculiar People, That Keep the Commandments of God, and the Faith of Jesus, compiled by James White, was first advertised for sale the following month in the March 1850 issue of The Present Truth. It contained the words for 53 hymns and sold for 12 1/2 cents.\nSee: James White, compiler, Hymns, for God's Peculiar People; “Hymns for God's Peculiar People … ,” Present Truth, March 1850, p. 64.

The connection between Bates and the Hastingses alluded to in this letter can be confirmed in the existing three personal letters from Joseph Bates to Leonard and Elvira Hastings during the period 1848-1849. It is also clear from James White's correspondence that Joseph Bates had visited the Hastingses in New Ipswich, New Hampshire, during the autumn of 1849. In addition, the connection between Bates and Chamberlain indicated in this letter corresponds well with the movements of Joseph Bates and lay preacher E.L.H. Chamberlain who, during the period 1849-1851, interacted several times on committees and meetings.\nSee: Search term “Bates,” “Hastings,” and “Chamberlain” in Words of the Pioneers; James White to Leonard and Elvira Hastings, Jan. 3, 1850. a dream which if he had followed, he would have been with you in your wife's distress; and if Brother Chamberlain [Ezra L.

Chamberlain is increased by the fact that she describes him in this letter as a preacher (even though “it was not his duty to travel”), which matches the description in the Review of his preaching activities.\nSee: Search term “Chamberlain” in Words of the Pioneers. had not been with him, he would have gone to God alone, and he would have seen by the dream and by the drawings of the Spirit that he must come directly to your house when Satan had got your wife in his grasp, and by faith in God would have wrenched her from the power of the enemy.

The “rappings” in the house of the Fox sisters in Hydesville, near Rochester, New York, had first started on March 31, 1848. See Ellen White's vision of March 24, 1849, for her earliest extant warning against the phenomenon (Ms 1, 1849 [Mar. 24]). It was not until November 1849, however, when the first public demonstrations of spirit contact took place in Corinthian Hall, Rochester, that spiritualism began to sweep the country “like a prairie fire.” This would harmonize well with Ellen White's statement here, some eight months later, that “the signs and mighty wonders of the devil have increased within a few months ten fold.”\nFor one account of the rapid spread of spiritualism in 1849 and the early 1850s, see Paul Kurtz, The Transcendental Temptation, pp. 322-325.

Taken together, these items indicate strongly that Ellen White is referring to Richard Gorsline of Oswego, New York.\nSee: Search term “Gorsline” in Words of the Pioneers; Eld.

He is now doing that work.4 During August, September, and November of 1850 James White published several issues of The Advent Review. It contained mostly reprints of articles by prominent Millerite leaders such as William Miller and J. B. Cook written in 1844 and 1845 supporting the prophetic significance of October 22, 1844. Articles on the Sabbath and sanctuary by Cook and O.R.L. Crosier also were included.

There are two indications that this is the case. First, it is clear that “Brother Lillis” lived in Oswego, since we know that Ellen White was in Oswego on that “Monday evening” (i.e., July 29, 1850—see Ms 5, 1850). Second, we are told that the meeting took place in the Lillis home. There is some evidence that Henry Lillis's home was used for meetings.\nSee: O.R.L. Crosier, “Brief Tour: Oswego-Auburn-Seneca Falls-Geneva,” Advent Harbinger and Bible Advocate, Aug. 16, 185, p. 70; [James White], “The Cause Wounded,” Review, Aug. 19, 1851, p. 11.

White Letters and Manuscripts: Volume 1, p. 212.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I saw the powers of darkness were rising. Satan has come down in great power, knowing that his time is short. Said the angel, as he pointed to Israel, “Art thou rising? Thou art upon the enchanted ground.7 An allusion to the allegorical “Enchanted Ground” found in John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. Of all the dangers awaiting Christian pilgrims on their journey, none are greater than those facing them in the Enchanted Ground, where the very air makes travelers drowsy, inviting a sleep from which there will be no awakening.\nSee: John Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress, p. 209. Dost thou not see it? Awake and arise and put on the strength of the Lord.” I was pointed back to the children of Israel in Egypt. I saw when God worked through Moses before Pharaoh the magicians came up and said they could do the same. I saw the same work was now going on in the world and among the professed churches similar to the work of the magicians anciently. I saw the power of the magicians has increased tenfold, within a few months, and it will still be on the increase and spread, and unless Israel is rising and increasing in power and strength and is growing in grace and in the knowledge of the truth, the powers of darkness will get the victory over them.8 It is likely that in this paragraph Ellen White is referring to the recent and rapid rise of spiritualism. The language is very similar to that of her report of a vision given three weeks later on August 24 (Ms 7, 1850) which makes explicit mention of the “rappings” and of spiritualism. The rappings in the house of the Fox sisters in Hydesville, near Rochester, New York, had first started on March 31, 1848. Ellen White's first extant warning concerning them was her March 24, 1849, vision (see Ms 1, 1849). It was not until November 1849, however, when the first public demonstration of spirit contact took place in Corinthian Hall, Rochester, that spiritualism began to sweep the country “like a prairie fire.” This would harmonize well with Ellen White's statement here that “the power of the magicians has increased tenfold, within a few months.”\nFor one account of the rapid spread of spiritualism in 1849 and the early 1850s, see Paul Kurtz, The Transcendental Temptation: A Critique of Religion and the Paranormal, pp. 322-325. I saw we must be constantly rising and keep the ascendency above the powers of darkness.

It caused some to follow for the loaves and fishes,3 In a parallel account Ellen White elaborates on this thought: “I saw that the object of selling was not to give to those who are able to labor and support themselves; but to spread the truth. It is a sin to support and indulge those who are able to labor, in idleness.”\nSee: E. G. White, “Dear Brethren and Sisters,” Present Truth, November 1850, p. 86. and now they are ready to be purged out. Falsehoods have been in their mouths. I saw that Bro. Bates's holding up “sell that ye have &c.” in a wrong light had caused those who had been coveting others’ property to take lenity4 “Lenity” is probably used here in its now-obsolete sense of a “lenitive,” i.e., something capable of easing pain or discomfort. The meaning of this passage would then be that some of the poorer members took comfort from—indeed, rejoiced in—Bates's radical demand that wealthier members should sell their properties, for they expected that some of the proceeds would be used to alleviate their poverty. from it and to rejoice and triumph, and had also caused those who had property to hold on to it.5 The situation described in this paragraph had been touched upon by James White some months earlier. In November 1849 he complained of “some fiery spirits” in western New York “whose principal message was ‘Sell that ye have and give alms.’” The influx of means brought about by such appeals had not always been used wisely. Two months later White wrote of “means … squandered away, and worse than lost in W. New York.” Ellen White's vision given here places some responsibility for this state of affairs on Joseph Bates. Bates's radical interpretation of Christ's instruction can be seen in a tract published in January 1849. He cites the revolutions taking place in Europe as portents of the time of trouble and urges members to sell their properties and not to delay with the hope that prices would rise. Ellen White, also writing in January 1849, had a considerably more qualified message. “I saw that God had not required all of His people to dispose of their property at the same time, but in a time of need He would teach them … when to sell and how much to sell.”\nSee: James White to Bro. Howland, in Ellen G. White, Spiritual Gifts [vol. 2], p. 119; James White to Leonard Hastings, Jan. 10, 1850; Joseph Bates, A Seal of the Living God, pp. 68, 69; Ellen G. White, “To Those Who Are Receiving the Seal of the Living God,” (broadside, Jan. 31, 1849). Those who had been coveting were zealous to attend conference with their families, not to glorify God, but for the loaves and the fishes. They had better remained at home and worked with their hands to supply the wants of their families and to have something to give to sustain the cause of truth."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 237.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

He took His disciples away alone, separate from the wicked, and first washed their feet, and then gave them to eat of the broken bread to represent His broken body and gave them to drink of the juice of the vine to represent His spilled blood.6 The position taken here needs to be seen in the context of the times. The bitter disputes of 1845 over the rite of foot washing had pitted the majority of Adventists against this, as it seemed to them “fanatical practice.” When Sabbatarian Adventists subsequently continued to practice foot washing, the opprobrium of other Adventist bodies was clear. Joseph Bates wrote in 1848 of Sabbatarians as “very despised,” and that they were given derogatory names, such as “‘door-shutters,’ ‘mystery folks,’ ‘Jewdeizers’ [sic], ‘feet washers,’ ‘deluded fanatics,’ etc.” Adding to the controversy was the question of foot washing between the sexes. In this context the instruction to avoid causing unnecessary “reproach” by practicing foot washing with nonmembers present can be understood.\nSee: Joseph Bates, A Vindication of the Seventh-day Sabbath, p. 6; Donald D.

However, one sign of discord can be found in Bates's opposition to White's publication of The Present Truth, which had driven White to despair at the end of 1849. Another sign is White's complaint in a letter that Bates's radical call for members to sell their properties had led to money being “squandered away, and worse than lost.” Despite this criticism White continues the letter on a conciliatory note. “I do not doubt for a moment Brother Bates’ good will and kindness toward us. Still he does not see everything correctly at one glance.” In a chapter entitled “Patriarchs in Conflict and the Transfer of Leadership,” Joseph Bates's biographer George R.

The book of life contains the good deeds of the saints, and the book of death contains the evil deeds of the wicked. These books were compared with the statute book—the Bible—and according to that they were judged. The saints in unison with Jesus passed their judgment upon the wicked dead. Behold ye, said the angel, the saints sit in unison with Jesus and mete out to each of the wicked according to the deeds done in the body, and it is set off against their names what they must receive at the execution of the judgment. This I saw was the work of the saints with Jesus through the 1000 years.10 Ellen White's vision of the judgment and last-time events was given at Sutton, Vermont, possibly during the conference held September 26-29, 1850. According to the account given in The Present Truth, there was significant disagreement among the conference participants “relative to the Judgment, etc.” Earlier that same month James White had again taken a strong stand against Joseph Bates's views on the subject. The account continues, however, that “before we left the place of meeting our trials were all removed. Errors were confessed, and perfect union, as sweet as heaven, was felt among us all.” It may be that the instruction Ellen White received in vision, as outlined in this section of the manuscript, was instrumental in helping to bring about agreement.\nSee: “Conferences,” Advent Review, November 1850, p. 72; “The Day of Judgment,” Advent Review, September 1850, pp. 49-51; George R.

Bates wrote for them until the last, and now in the gathering time when precious souls that have been hid beneath the rubbish and have not had the privilege of hearing the truth, need light from different ones, his testimony has been withheld.13 Joseph Bates's contributions to “dying” Adventist papers may be illustrated by two letters with substantial theological content that he had had submitted to S. S. Snow's Jubilee Standard during its brief existence of four months during 1845. By contrast, Bates had written nothing for The Present Truth or The Advent Review until September 1850. Part of the reason for his reticence to contribute articles may well have been his objection, in principle, to the publishing of periodicals, an objection that had brought deep discouragement to James White. However, the admonition to Bates found in this vision of September 1850 appears to have given him a strong impetus to write. When the new periodical, the Second Advent Review and Sabbath Herald, began publication two months later, Bates became not only a frequent contributor of substantial articles but also a member of the publishing committee.\nSee: Joseph Bates, “Letter From Bro.

According to White's interpretation, the dust and rubbish represent the “darkness and error” that had covered “the clear light of … the third angel's message.” Ellen White here uses the metaphor to refer to those who accepted the Advent call in 1844 but who had since then been misled by various post-1844 theories.

The expression “plain on tables” was taken from Habakkuk 2:2, 3 and had been applied by the Millerites earlier to their use of prophetic charts. The summons for Sabbatarian Adventists to publish a chart was quickly acted upon. Three months later 300 copies of a prophetic chart prepared by Otis Nichols were ready for distribution.\nSee: Ellen G. White, Lt 26, 1850 (Nov. 1); “The Chart,” Review, January 1851, p. 38.

I saw that the figures on the chart were as God wanted them, and that His hand was over and hid a mistake in some of the figures so that none could see it until His hand was removed.8 A parallel account substitutes “1843 chart” for “old chart.” This chart, widely used by the Millerites, displayed calculations that the Second Advent would take place in 1843, not recognizing the computational error involved. The assertion here that God's “hand was over and hid a mistake in some of the figures” has been the occasion of much discussion and debate. On the one hand are those who, like D. M. Canright, exclaim, “God helped them make the mistake!” and who make this a reason to reject the authenticity of the visions. Others, such as F. D. Nichol, point to biblical examples in which God conceals truth from people for a while for purposes of testing. Thus, God concealed the true nature of His purposes from Abraham for some time when he was commanded to take his son to Mount Moriah. This was the position taken by Ellen White. In 1858 she wrote, “I saw that God was in the proclamation of the time in 1843. It was His design to arouse the people, and bring them to a testing point.”\nSee: D. M.

Andrews) first propose that the United States of America be identified with the “two-horned” beast of Revelation 13.\nSee: J. N. Andrews, “Thoughts on Revelation XIII and XIV,” Review, May 19, 1851, pp. 82-84. For the development of early Sabbatarian interpretation of the two-horned beast, see P.

Then I saw the mother of harlots, that the mother was not the daughters, but separate and distinct from them.10 In the main, this exposition of Revelation 17 follows earlier Millerite thinking that after 1843 increasingly identified “Babylon … mother of harlots” with the Roman Catholic Church and her offspring harlots as the apostate Protestant churches. The general identification of “Babylon” with Roman Catholicism had a much longer past, reflecting a common position among Protestant scholars going back to the Reformation.\nMore specifically, this passage may have been directed against the position taken by James White during the 1850s, which tended to downplay the Roman Catholic identity of “Babylon” in Revelation 17. As pointed out by Damsteegt, White seems to have taken his cue for the identification of “Babylon” in Revelation 17 from his understanding of “Babylon” in the second angel's message of Revelation 14. He insisted that since Millerites had not been called out of the Catholic Church in 1843-1844, but out of the Protestant “nominal” churches, “Babylon” did not include the Catholic Church. Turning to “Babylon” in Revelation 17, in an 1851 article, while paying lip service to the Roman Catholic “Mother” and Protestant “harlots” schema of the Millerites, James White sought to conflate the two, seeing them instead as “a family of harlots”… “symbolical of all the churches.” The assertion in Ms 15 that “the mother … [is] not the daughters, but separate and distinct from them” seems to be a rejection of this approach. Though James White's article in December 1851 cited above was published after the vision recorded in Ms 15, 1850, yet he may well have held the opinions expressed there earlier.\nSee: James White, “Come out of Babylon!” Review, Dec. 9, 1851, p. 58; P.

When union existed before 1844, nearly all were united on the correct view of the “daily,” but since, in the confusion, other views have been embraced and darkness has followed.17 In a parallel account of this vision, published a few weeks later, Ellen White gives a fuller report of this section of the vision: “Then I saw in relation to the ‘daily,’ that the word ‘sacrifice’ was supplied by man's wisdom, and does not belong to the text; and that the Lord gave the correct view of it to those who gave the judgment hour cry. When union existed, before 1844, nearly all were united on the correct view of the ‘daily’; but since 1844, in the confusion, other views have been embraced, and darkness and confusion has followed.” This expanded passage suggests that “the correct view” was that “the word ‘sacrifice’ was supplied by man's wisdom.”\nThe issue here relates to the activities of the “little horn” power of Daniel 8 by which “the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down” (verse 11). Millerite expositors had opposed the interpretation held by some that the reference here was to Antiochus Epiphanes, who violated the Temple at Jerusalem and stopped Temple sacrifices for a period of about three years in the second century B. C. A common Millerite counterargument was that the word “sacrifice” was not in the original text, but was supplied by the KJV translators.\nEllen White's vision confirms the Millerite view that the word “sacrifice” was supplied “by man's wisdom.” But the vision goes on to lament the fact that “since 1844, in the confusion, other views have been embraced.” Julia Neuffer points out that among those “other views” was the position among emerging Literalist (“age-to-come”) Adventists in the late 1840s and early 1850s that “daily sacrifice” was a reference to the future restoration of Jewish Temple rites in Jerusalem.\nIn the early twentieth century, considerable controversy arose among church leaders as to whether this passage confirmed the “old” view of “the daily” against the “new” view being argued by Prescott, Daniells, and others.\nSee: E. G. White, “Dear Brothers and Sisters,” Present Truth, November 1850, p. 87; Julia Neuffer, “The Gathering of Israel,” p. 12.

Minor]19 Clorinda Minor, former Millerite writer and speaker, adopted a strong Literalist position in the later 1840s and 1850s, actively supporting the emigration of Jews to Palestine and their conversion to Christianity, in preparation for the Second Advent. After a preliminary trip to Palestine in 1849, Mrs. Minor returned to the United States in the spring of 1850 to promote and raise funds for a group of farmer-settlers to go to Palestine to further their Literalist agenda. This is the background for the warnings found in Ellen White's vision, given later the same year.\nSee: Moshe Davis, America and the Holy Land, p. 173; Barbara Kreiger with Shalom Goldman, Divine Expectations, an American Woman in 19th-Century Palestine; Julia Neuffer, “The Gathering of Israel,” pp. 12, 13; SDAE, s.v. “Clorinda S.

Accepting R. C. Gorgas's vision predicting that the Second Advent would take place at 3:00 a.m. on October 22, 1844, she joined in leading an exodus of Millerites out of Philadelphia to await the Advent.

Foey's [John Green Foy]18 Identity: Surprisingly there is no trace of the name “Foey” in the Review. Neither is there any person by that name in all the state of Maine in the 1850 census. The probability therefore is that there is a spelling discrepancy here. It is likely that Ellen White is referring to John Green Foy, of Brunswick, Maine. Brunswick is just across the Androscoggin River from Topsham, which corresponds with Ellen White's account that they “hastened over the river one mile [1.6 kilometers]” from Topsham. Ellen White later in life reminisced about “Brother Foy and his family of Brunswick” who had “accepted the Sabbath truth” together with the Stockbridge Howland family of nearby Topsham “a few years” after 1844. According to John Foy's obituary in 1861, his wife had died earlier, leaving him with six children. The fact of his wife's prior death fits well with Ellen White's account. The only discrepancy is that Ellen White in this letter gives the number of the Foy children as three, whereas the obituary and the 1850 census mention six children. On balance, however, the evidence in favor of the proposed identity seems to outweigh the discrepancy over the number of children.\nSee: Search terms “Foey” and “Foy” in Words of the Pioneers; Ellen G.

Whether there is any connection between that Oren Hewitt and the “Oren Hewett” of New York State mentioned in the Review in the early 1850s cannot be established on the basis of present evidence.\nSee: “Brother Oren Hewett Writes From Dead River,” Advent Herald, May 8, 1847, p. 111; “Bro.

The united position of Sabbatarian expositors during this and subsequent stages was that the 1335 day/year period had ended in 1843/1844. Ellen White's statement here, however, if taken on its own, is rather ambiguous and could be taken as denying that the 1335 days had ended (and affirming that its fulfillment was still future). Some have cited this Ellen White letter to support the idea of a future literal 1335-day period just preceding the Second Advent. Such an interpretation of the vision, however, runs counter to Ellen White's caution given just one month earlier “that God had not made a test of time since 1844, and that time never again will be a test” (Ms 15, 1850 [Oct. 23]). Therefore the alternative reading of the passage seems preferable, viz.: “We told him … that the 1335 days were ended.” This reading is confirmed if, in fact, “Brother Hewitt” is Oren Hewett, of Dead River, Maine (see note 19 above). Oren Hewett (Hewitt) wrote several supportive letters to The Bible Advocate in 1847, an Adventist paper that repeatedly set new times for the Second Advent, times often held to coincide with the ending of the 1335 days/years (see, e.g., Blakeslee, Wilcox, and Bates below). It would therefore be understandable for Hewett, coming from The Bible Advocate background, to see the 1335 days stretching beyond 1844, and for Ellen White and the Sabbatarians to oppose him on this point.\nSee: Ellen G. White, Ms 15, 1850 (Oct. 23); E. S. Blakeslee, “Time of the Advent,” Bible Advocate, Sept. 2, 1847, p. 34; L. Wilcox, “Brother L.

I am going to the Kingdom, will you go with me?’ One of them fell upon his knees on the floor, and cried out, ‘I will, I will.’ And such a scene followed as cannot be described—all fell upon their knees, some were crying for mercy, others for a closer walk with God, and some for salvation, full and free.

Had the vision been “influenced” by what Belinda Loveland told Ellen White concerning the Hollis case? The question of whether Ellen White had prior knowledge of matters shown her in vision was seen by some as of central importance. But she makes the point in this letter that even if she had had prior information about Hollis, “would that affect the vision that God gives me? … My opinion has nothing to do with what God has shown me in vision.”\nSee also: Lt 3, 1847 (July 13), note 7."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 274.5","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

But those who oppose the seventh-day Sabbath are cut up and divided; there are hardly two agreed.3 Several articles opposing the Sabbath had appeared in the Advent Herald and Advent Harbinger during the spring of 1851 before Ellen White received this vision. Earlier, in 1847-1848, the Bible Advocate had run a major series of letters and articles debating the Sabbath issue. The point made here about contradictory arguments being used against the Sabbath can be illustrated from the writings of Joseph Turner. He had argued in the autumn of 1847 that Sunday is in actual fact the seventh day and therefore the true Sabbath of the commandment. By the following May, Turner had abandoned this position, arguing instead that for the Christian the law is abolished.\nSee: “Repairing the Breach,” Review, June 2, 1851, p. 95, for a contemporary survey of articles opposing the Sabbath in the non-sabbatarian Adventist press. Merlin Burt provides an extensive analysis of the Sabbatarian debate of 1847-1848 in “Sabbatarian Adventism From 1844 to 1849,” pp. 326-352. One comes forward in opposition to the Sabbath commandment and declares it to be thus and so, and at the conclusion calls it settled; then a second comes up and tears the first down, and declares it to be some other way. But they will not have it, any of them, that the seventh day is the Sabbath, and they do not agree among themselves, but are blind and dishonest and are standing out against the Sabbath commandment. They want to silence the flock, therefore they get up something to silence them and lull them to sleep upon these truths which condemn them and cut them off. Their followers read their Bibles so little that error could be easily made by these blind leaders to appear like truth, and the followers receive it as such, not looking any higher than their leaders, and they, having a disposition to get rid of the fourth commandment, love these errors and love to have it so."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 279.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

They were looking to the visions and were anxious to know more about them.4 Three months earlier traveling preacher George W. Holt had visited former Millerites in the West Milton—Ballston Spa area of New York with the result that some “embraced the truth in full.” Possibly in response to Ellen White's vision on May 14, recorded in this manuscript, a “general conference” was arranged for the weekend of June 27-29, 1851, at which several prominent preachers, including the Whites, spoke. In July Ellen White wrote from Ballston Spa that “there is quite a company in this vicinity who are out in all the truth.” Apparently a number of the new Sabbathkeepers in the West Milton—Ballston Spa area had doubts about the visions of Ellen White. She wrote on July 21, “The visions trouble many. They [know] not what to make of them.” The issue was no doubt particularly pressing since the Whites settled in Ballston Spa after the conference and later in nearby Saratoga Springs, so that the one having the visions was living right among them. It may well have been in part to meet the many questions being raised that Ellen White's first book was published in August (A Sketch of the Christian Experience and Views of Ellen G. White) containing biographical material and a selection of her most prominent visions.\nSee: Geo. W. Holt, “From Bro. Holt,” Review, March 1851, p. 56; Horace Cushman, “Conferences,” Review, May 19, 1851, p. 88; Ellen G. White, Lt 7, 1851 (July 27); Lt 4, 1851 (July 21); idem, A Sketch of the Christian Experience and Views of Ellen G. White. Then I saw that Bro. John [John Nevins Andrews]5 Identity: The information given here that “Bro. John” is staying in Paris and is a writer clearly identifies him as John Nevins Andrews.

Andrews had already published several weighty articles in The Present Truth and Review and was a member of the Review publishing committee from its inception in November 1850. must stay but a short time in Paris6 According to notices in the Review, J. N. Andrews left Paris during the summer of 1851 and followed the Review office to Saratoga Springs and Rochester, New York, not to return to his parents’ home for any period of time until his health failed in 1855.\nSee: [Notice], Review, Sept. 2, 1851, p. 24; [Notice], Review, Mar. 23, 1852, p. 112; “The Office,” Review, Feb. 20, 1855, p. 182.

And I saw that one could not always bring out clear light upon every point in a subject, as two could who understood the same subject, and that John should watch carefully and if he could make any other point in the subject of the parable, or any other subject, clearer, it was his duty to do so. Then I saw that this band must have steady, living faith, more faith, and draw down the blessings from God. I saw that faith had been but little in exercise among the band, and that they must get ready, for the clouds are gathering and will soon burst upon us.7 More details concerning the problematic state of the Paris, Maine, band are given by Ellen White in Lt 3, 1851 (Aug. 11). Ron Graybill traces the at-times-troubled history of two prominent Sabbatarian families in Paris, the Andrewses and the Stevenses, from the 1840s to the early 1860s, in “The Family Man,” in Harry Leonard, ed., J.

I was shown that there was a link between Brethren Andrews’ and Stevens’ families [Edward Andrews and Cyprian Stevens]2 Identity: The mention of the unhealthy “link” between the Andrews and Stevens families letter and their doubts about the visions, finds an echo in a later letter in which Ellen White writes of the Andrews and Stevens families of Paris who “strengthened each other's hands in sympathizing and linking together,” and who “despised the visions.” The reference must be to the families of Edward Andrews and Cyprian Stevens, who lived in Paris, Maine, until the mid-1850s.\nSee: Ellen G.

This link did not tend to make them strengthen each other in the most holy faith, or to cause one another to grow in grace, but it did tend, if they were wrong, to make them build one another up in that wrong and hide each other's faults that needed to be brought out and got rid of in order to have the approbation of God and His free, strengthening Spirit among them. This attachment that bound one to the other was not formed because each family was so holy and reflected the image of Jesus so fully.3 Further details regarding the nature of the “link” between the two families are given by Ellen White in later documents. During the period October 1850 to June 1851 when the Whites lived in Paris, Ellen had conveyed certain reproofs for members of the families, given in vision. James had reiterated and upheld the reproofs. The two families did not react positively, but reinforced each other's resentment. Nine years later, in 1860, their negative sentiments were unchanged. In the words of Ellen White: “When in Paris you strengthened each other's hands in sympathizing and linking together. … There was not deep searching of heart to confess wrongs and make thorough work by the two families. The same feelings exist with them now. They have despised reproof, despised the visions.” By the early 1860s, however, several members of the two families showed a change of heart. Letters of apology and confession are on file, including one from Pauline Stevens, who writes, “I can now see that our folks and Sr. Andrews did very wrong in talking over our grievances together.”\nSee: Ellen G.

Apparently the Andrews and Stevens families were less than helpful in assisting the Whites in setting up their own household. Years later Pauline Stevens, daughter of Cyprian Stevens, expressed her regrets to Ellen White: “I should have been willing to let you have things to have assisted you in keeping house such as armchairs, looking glass …”\nSee: James White to E. P. Butler, Dec. 12, 1861; P. R. Stevens to Ellen G.

I was shown the danger of doubting the visions. Had you believed the visions in time back, you would not have been left to go into the error you did.5 Ellen White writes elsewhere of the Andrews and Stevens families that “for years … [they had been] held in error, fanaticism and darkness.” While few details are known, Ellen White later recalled that Edward Andrews was at one time deeply involved in “no-work” fanaticism. “There is nothing that would have brought Brother Andrews out of his idea that they must not work, and that they would be supported by the outside people.” Andrews's sister-in-law, Persis Sibley Andrews Black, made a similar observation in a diary entry in March 1846 concerning “brother Edward [Andrews], who—poor deluded man—with his family still believe in the speedy coming of Christ … [and] have done no labor for more than two years and have lived in constant expectation that every day the world wo'd be consumed by fire.”\nMarion Crawford (née Stowell), a member of the band of Sabbathkeepers in Paris in the 1840s recalled, in a letter written in 1908 to W. C. White, that Cyprian Stevens for a time practiced religious creeping. “One time at South Paris,” she wrote, “Cyprian Stevens got down in front of the stage coach full of passengers. It frightened the horses so it nearly upset the coach. The driver handed the lines to a man that sat beside him, jumped down with his whip, and gave Bro. Stevens the full benefit of it. One eye was badly swollen and his whole face was bruised as well as his body.”\nSee: Ellen G.

In a way, these warnings are quite surprising since Sabbatarians had eschewed time setting and had often made the point that it was the non-Sabbatarian Adventists who had set time after time in the years following 1844. In 1850-1851, however, a brief flurry of time-setting broke out among some Sabbatarians, mostly in Vermont and New Hampshire. Joseph Bates appears to have been the prime mover, having published a pamphlet sometime during 1850 arguing briefly (and almost incidentally) for the Second Advent in the autumn of 1851. His ideas, however, were never given any support in the Review; indeed, James White wrote against them in the summer of 1851.

I saw that God loved her and frowned upon the course of the band; that if God bore no more with them than they had borne of some of their numbers He would long since have withdrawn His mercy from them and left them wholly to themselves.1 Further details on the relationship between Almira Preston and the company in Camden, New York, can be found in a parallel account in Spiritual Gifts in which Ellen White tells of a certain “Sr. E. P.” of Camden. There are clear similarities in the two accounts that indicate that “E. P.” is in fact Almira Preston:\nMs 2, 1851: “I saw that Sister Almira Preston was a child of God and that the band had been very wrong and had not stood in the light of God's countenance. I saw that the destiny of a soul should never hang on dreams or impressions, that these two things have governed the band much.”\nSpiritual Gifts [vol. 2], p. 150: “I … saw that some of the church had been disfellowshipped without sufficient cause, through the influence of dreams and impressions. I was shown that Sr. E. P. was a child of God, and they had no cause for rejecting her.”\nThe reasons Ellen White uses “E. P.” instead of “A. P.” in Spiritual Gifts can be accounted for by the fact that she uses variant spellings: “Almira” and “Elmira.” The former spelling is found in Ms 2, 1851, and the latter in Ms 2a, 1851 (June 23), a variant of Ms 2.\nAssuming that the “E. P.” of Spiritual Gifts is in fact Almira Preston, we get further interesting detail there, including the information that her husband “had bound her with cords so tightly as to much bruise her” to prevent her coming to the meeting at which the Whites were present. Also included in this account is the reaction of the Camden company to Ellen White's vision of their unfair treatment of Almira Preston: “I related the vision given me for the church, and those who had acted a part in casting her off confessed to her heartily. It was an affecting time. Many wept aloud.”\nSee: Ellen G. White, Spiritual Gifts [vol. 2], pp. 150, 151; idem, Ms 2a, 1851 (June 23)."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 289.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

The Review of this period has several mentions of a Jesse Thompson of Ballston Spa, New York. George W.

Then shall we see the Sabbath more in its importance and glory. But [we] shall not see it in all its glory and importance until the covenant of peace is made with us at the voice of God, and the pearly gates of the New Jerusalem are thrown open and swing back on their glittering hinges, and the glad and joyful voice of the lovely Jesus is heard, richer than any music that ever fell on mortal ear, bidding us to enter, that we had a perfect right in the city, for we had kept the commandments of God, and heaven, sweet heaven is our home, for we have kept the commandments of God.5 For a complementary perspective, compare this statement with the following parallel passage found in Ellen White's first vision, “Jesus … laid hold of the pearly gate, swung it back on its glittering hinges, and said to us, ‘You have washed your robes in My blood, stood stiffly for My truth, enter in.’ We all marched in and felt we had a perfect right in the city” (Early Writings, p. 17).\nThe formulation in Lt 3, 1851, which focuses on the commandments of God, is clearly an amplification of Revelation 22:14: “Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city” (KJV). Clearly, an understanding of the teaching of the early visions on salvation and its grounds cannot be based on isolated statements but requires an integrated analysis of all relevant passages.

The time had passed and left those who believed in it very low and dark, and the influence of those who believed the time has been very distracting.8 Several persons mentioned in this letter, including E. P. Butler, had been caught up in the minority time-setting movement that expected the Second Advent in October 1851. Sabbatarian Adventists in general had eschewed time-setting and had often made the point that it was the other Adventist bodies that had repeatedly set times for the Advent in the years following 1844. In 1849, however, Hiram Edson had published a pamphlet predicting the Second Advent in 1850. Little is known of the influence of that pamphlet. Of more consequence was a brief flurry of time-setting in 1850-1851 that broke out among some Sabbatarians, mostly in Vermont and New Hampshire. Joseph Bates appears to have been the prime mover, having published a pamphlet sometime during 1850 arguing briefly (and almost incidentally) for the Second Advent in the autumn of 1851. His ideas, however, were never given any support in the Review; indeed, James White wrote against them in the summer of 1851. This, together with the warnings in the visions (both of which were published in the Review), weakened the movement well before the anticipated time. Those who persisted in holding to the 1851 theory tended to be skeptical of the visions that contradicted their ideas, as can be seen in the events of this letter.\nSee: Hiram Edson, The Time of the End; Joseph Bates, An Explanation of the Typical and Anti-Typical Sanctuary, pp. 10, 11; “Our Present Work,” Review, Aug. 19, 1851, p. 13.

Timm, The Sanctuary and the Three Angels’ Messages, pp. 68, 69; EGWEnc, s.v. “Time Setting.” Brother Holt [George W. Holt]9 Identity: The Review had earlier announced that “Bro. G. W. Holt” would come to the Washington, New Hampshire, conference. Holt was one of the “preaching brethren” who spoke at the various conferences attended by the Whites on this journey.\nSee: “Conferences,” Review, Oct. 21, 1851, p. 48; “Our Tour East,” Review, Nov. 25, 1851, p. 52. talked on the gifts of the Spirit.

Basic to these views was the reign of Christ on earth during the 1,000 years, the continuance of probation during the millennium, and the conversion and restoration of Jerusalem to the Jews.

Evidently age-to-come teachings held an appeal even to a few Sabbathkeepers, hence the admonishment given here.\nSee: Julia Neuffer, “The Gathering of Israel”; SDAE, s.v. “Messenger Party”; David Tallmadge Arthur, “‘Come Out of Babylon,’” pp. 224-227; George R.

I asked Brother Walker where he would be or what would be his state if Jesus had now left the Most Holy and His work for the saints was all done and he in the state he then was? I talked plainly. The Lord helped me. I showed them how the messengers that had been toiling in the scattering time had labored to get the truth before them, how much they had suffered, and now when God's cause was prospering, they embrace the third angel's message and enter into the labors of the chosen messengers of God and lift up their heel against them.

Improperly practiced, the holy kiss had the potential of causing public scandal and charges of fanaticism, as had happened in 1845-1846. The majority of Adventist bodies rejected both foot washing and the holy kiss.\nSee: SDAE, s.v. “Foot Washing”; Ellen G. White, Supplement to the Christian Experience and Views of Ellen G.

A faction of Adventists rejected the central Millerite teaching of the literal Second Advent and instead held that Christ had come spiritually to believers in 1844. This spiritualized interpretation of the Second Advent led, in a few extreme cases, to the practice of “spiritual wifery.” Millerite historian David Arthur suggests the following logic behind the practice: “This practice was based on the scriptural idea that in the kingdom of heaven there would be no marrying or giving in marriage. Since these were persons who believed that they were immortal and had entered the kingdom, it followed that they were now in their spiritual state. They also took Christ's statement concerning hating and forsaking the family in order to follow Him as a literal command. The former idea led to ‘spiritual’ couples or to a ‘spiritual matrimony without sexual connexion.’”\nSee: David Tallmadge Arthur, “‘Come Out of Babylon,’” p. 121. See also George R.

Said she, I saw away off there in Europe just as things were moving to accomplish their desires, there would appear to be a slacking up once or twice. This would serve to harden the hearts of the wicked, but the work would not settle down, only appear to; for the minds of the rulers were as intent in sustaining themselves, as were the minds of the people to get the ascendancy.10 Adventist pioneer ministers disagreed on how this passage should be understood. This is not surprising, given its intermittent and almost cryptic character. J. N. Loughborough wrote in 1916 that Ellen White was referring in part to the revolutions that swept through central Europe in 1848 but that died down within a short space of time. “There was,” he wrote, “one slacking up after the revolution of 1848. In the present war, beginning in 1914, is manifest on a still larger scale the determination to overthrow kings and rulers. … The testimony seems to indicate a second slacking up before the final conflict of the nations shall come.” Alonzo T. Jones, on the other hand, speaking before the General Conference session in 1893, interpreted these statements in terms of future persecution by state-church alliances in Europe and America.\nSee: J. N. Loughborough, Questions on the Sealing Message (1916), p. 12, as in Words of the Pioneers; A. T. Jones, “The Third Angel's Message—No. 24,” General Conference Daily Bulletin, Mar. 26, 1893, p. 518. I saw that each party ruled and rulers were stretching their thoughts intensely on this work before them. The sins of Israel must go to judgment beforehand. Every sin must be confessed at the sanctuary.11 Based on 1 Timothy 5:24: “Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.” The reading given this text here is that those who confess their sins now will be clear in the coming judgment while the unrepentant will then face their unconfessed sins. “I warn all who profess the name of Christ to closely examine themselves and make full and thorough confession of all their wrongs, that they may go beforehand to judgment, and that the recording angel may write pardon opposite their names” (Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, p. 263). Then the work will move; it must be done now (“now” probably referred to some present). The remnant in the time of trouble will cry, “My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?”12 “In the time of trouble, if the people of God had unconfessed sins to appear before them while tortured with fear and anguish, they would be overwhelmed; despair would cut off their faith, and they could not have confidence to plead with God for deliverance. But while they have a deep sense of their unworthiness, they have no concealed wrongs to reveal. Their sins have gone beforehand to judgment, and have been blotted out” (Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, p. 620)."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 324.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

(This was most likely Oren Hewett, despite the variant spelling, the only person with that initial and surname in the Review from this period.) This may or may not mean that Hewett was the scribe. According to J. N. Loughborough, the manuscript was “found among Brother Bates's papers, after his death,” which raises the possibility that it was Joseph Bates who recorded the vision. One typed copy of this manuscript, dated May 3, 1903, bears Ellen White's handwritten interlinear comments (inserted in this text between the < > symbols), indicating her acceptance of the contents. Whether she also wrote her own report of the vision is not known.\nA study of the parallel account of the March 14 vision in Ms 2, 1852, suggests that at least part of the Ms 1 text consists of Ellen White's explanations of her vision to the gathered assembly after coming out of vision rather than her utterances while in vision.

Prior to 1852 Sabbatarian Adventists had thought of the “fall” of the churches as a past event, culminating in 1844 with the second angel's message of Revelation 14 and the call to leave the churches of “Babylon.” In June 1852, however, James White first published a broader view of continuing deterioration in the churches after 1844, leading to a future and final warning to come out of Babylon, a view that was to become the dominant one among Seventh-day Adventists. It may be that this vision, given a few months earlier, in March 1852, provided the impetus for James White's seminal article.\nSee: [James White], “Babylon,” Review, June 24, 1852, p. 9.

There was too much talking over a brother's or a sister's faults among the band or church, and the brother that was thought to be wrong kept in ignorance that any trial was existing in the minds of others concerning him, until his (considered) faults had been talked over and over by nearly all the church, and he felt the coldness of his brothers and sisters and knew not the cause until it broke out all of a sudden, and he [was] made aware of what has been going on. Then the confidence that he has previously had in his brethren is shaken, his love for them has begun to be weakened, and a breach is made at once in the band that was previously united.3 The band of Sabbathkeeping Adventists at Jackson was the first to be established in the state of Michigan, in 1849. A number of positive reports and letters had been published in the Review showing the commitment of the Jackson members. Nevertheless by the summer of 1852 problems of internal dissension and gossiping as indicated in this letter were surfacing. Joseph Bates admitted publicly in the Review that the band in Jackson had “been wading through manifold trials, and buffetings of the Enemy.” The testimony and appeal of Ellen White's June 2 letter appears to have contributed to a reconciliation among the members. Bates reports that at a conference held in Jackson three weeks after her letter was sent “God in answer to prayer … endowed His children with grace, which caused love and unity to prevail throughout the church.”\nSee: Brian E.

The question is whether he lived in Jackson, Michigan, at the time of this letter, i.e., June 1852. According to the 1850 census and early reports in The Present Truth and The Advent Review, H. S. Case lived in North Plains, Ionia County, some 60 or 70 miles [97-113 kilometers] north of Jackson. There is, however, evidence that he had moved to Jackson by or before 1852. Notices in the Review from February and May 1852 speak of Brother “Case, from Jackson Mich.” and of “H. S. Case [who] writes from Jackson.” Taken together, there seems little doubt that Ellen White is writing of Hiram S. Case.\nSee: Search term “Case” in Words of the Pioneers; 1850 U.S. Federal Census, “Hiram Case,” Michigan, Ionia County, Lyons, p. 312; Bowman R. Brown, “From Bro. Brown,” Review, May 6, 1852, p. 6. had been doing what he could, but he had not moved judiciously at all times, and had given the enemies of the truth some cause to reproach him and those who believed the truth. It was impossible for him to reach some. His testimony would do them no good. But I saw that God had worked for Brother Case because he had received the admonitions and advice of his brethren and had acted upon it, and if he was humble, God would work for him still. But he must be very careful before unbelievers how he speaks, lest he give the enemies of the truth cause to reproach Israel.5 Hiram S. Case, a former Millerite lecturer, had become a Sabbathkeeper in 1850. For a couple of years he traveled and preached widely in Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and Wisconsin. This letter from Ellen White provides the first recorded intimation of problems in his ministry. Despite the appeal made to Case in this letter and the hopes expressed that he would change his course, the problems had grown into a full-scale crisis by the following summer, as revealed in a June 1853 document. By 1854 he had broken with the movement and cofounded the opposition Messenger Party.\nSee: Ellen G. White, Ms 1, 1853 (June 2); EGWEnc, s.v. “Messenger Party.”"},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 330.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

In the October 14 issue James tells of his and Ellen's visit to Washington, New Hampshire, during the weekend of September 10-12, 1852. Ellen, he reports, received a vision the first evening. (James, as was sometimes his custom, used a more circuitous expression: “The Lord showed His willingness to bless His people assembled, by graciously pouring out His Spirit the first evening.”) He then gave what appears to be a summary of some of the highlights of the vision. Significantly, he began with the words “there was evidently a lack of active faith on the part of some of the brethren. Some had put the coming of the Lord too far off, and were getting worldly” (italics supplied). The similarity here with the opening sentence of Ms 4—“you are getting the coming of the Lord too far off”—seems too striking to be a coincidence. Added to the fact that the date and place of the manuscript (September 1852, Washington, New Hampshire) correspond with James White's report, it seems clear that Ms 4 and James White are speaking of the same vision. James's summary runs into five paragraphs centering on the self-deception of many who “think that a theory of the truth will save them, while they lack many things that constitute a Christian.”\nSee: James White, “Eastern Tour,” Review, Oct. 14, 1852, p. 96.

White. The drive by the Whites for a basic measure of church order in the early 1850s tended to concentrate on the problem of “self-sent” unauthorized preachers who lacked the skills and/or moral qualities needed to represent the young movement properly. James White echoed the sentiments of this passage in a series of articles in December 1853, also entitled “Gospel Order”: “He who enters upon the work of the gospel ministry, must be called of God, a man of experience, a holy man of God.”\nSee: Ellen G.

According to James White, the earliest vision given Ellen White against tobacco, tea, and coffee was in the autumn of 1848, although no contemporary account of that vision has been preserved.\nSee: James White, “Western Tour,” Review, Nov. 8, 1870, p. 165; EGWEnc, s.v. “Tobacco.” For surveys of the development of health reform among Seventh-day Adventists, see Herbert E.

Balancing such statements, however, is the insistence on the loving benevolence of God that ever seeks to draw the sinner to Himself. “All heaven is interested in your salvation,” she writes to young people in 1852. “God has given His only beloved Son to die for your transgressions, angels are watching over you, and are trying to turn your attention to God, to seek your soul's salvation.”\nSee: Ellen G.

But his hasty, overbearing spirit was much against him. Many more would have embraced the truth if he had not possessed such a spirit of severity.3 This is the earliest extant testimony of reproof for Samuel Rhodes, who in the early and mid-1850s was one of the young movement's most active and traveled preachers. His negative traits here pointed out—an overbearing spirit, severity and harshness—clearly remained with him, because Ellen White returned to this same problem time and time again in the 1850s and 1860s.

On the latter issue there is a letter of confession some weeks later in the Review from H. S. Case in which he regrets not seeing “the importance of a careful use of means that has been put into my hands. I have done wrong in using the Lord's money as I should not have done.” There can be no doubt that H. S. Case is referred to in this letter.\nSee: H. S. Case, “From Bro.

B. Bezzo in the Messenger of Truth provides some rare insights into the ministry of Hiram Case and his break with the Sabbatarian Adventists. It gives a glimpse into the financial support provided by Jackson members to Hiram Case and his family. Thus, in 1853 “Bro. Drew told Bro. Case that if he wo'd move to his place, he would furnish him with a cow, house to live in, and would help support his family while he was carrying the third angel's message.” It appears from Bezzo's article that the Jackson church had accepted financial responsibility for the Case family, an arrangement that was very unusual if not unique during the early 1850s, when most traveling preachers received only irregular financial support from the various companies they visited. Bezzo's article is, in the main, critical of the level of support provided for Hiram Case and family. Bezzo wrote in 1854 after both he and Case had joined the opposition Messenger Party.\nSee: J. B. Bezzo, “H. S. Case,” Messenger of Truth, Nov. 2, 1854, pp. [2-4].

And those who have no calling have been encouraged into the field.9 The problem of self-appointed preachers using up scarce donations in their travels continued to afflict the fledgling movement during the years before organization took place in the early 1860s. A Review article in 1852 reminded “those who have means” that they should not “bestow it upon every one who may profess to be called of God to preach. … They should first be satisfied that they are called of God to teach, before they give them means to travel.”\nSee: “The Faith of Jesus,” Review, Aug. 19, 1852, p. 61.

And these things must be confessed and taken out of the way before Brother Rhodes can be free, and move in the wisdom of God.15 Seven weeks after this vision was given, on July 23, 1853, Samuel Rhodes wrote a confession, in the manner of the times, that was published in the Review. “I see some things … which call for a confession on my part, which indeed is humiliating but shall be freely and frankly made. … I have not at all times possessed enough of the mind of Christ and have been left to a hurried, overbearing, oppressive spirit, and to deal out rebukes sometimes that were not dictated by the Spirit of the Lord.” It cannot be established with certainty that this “confession” was a direct response to Ellen White's vision of June 2, although it seems likely.

B. Bezzo gives an unflattering picture of John Bowles. Among other episodes Bezzo writes of a meeting held near Saline, Michigan, where “brother Bowles … arose and made some remarks, from which Sr. Kellogg got the idea that her children were lost. It had such an effect upon her mind that she became almost distracted; brother K. entertained fears that she would go crazy.”\nThe reproof given to John Bowles in this letter is very similar to that which he had received one year earlier, in June 1852. There is no indication that Bowles had changed his ways, and this may account for the stronger tone of this second letter. This is the last mention of John Bowles in the Ellen White letters and manuscripts. Three months later, in September 1853, he died “after a short illness, of the typhus fever.”\nSee: J. B. Bezzo, “H.

In October 1850 Ellen White had received instruction in vision that a prophetic chart should be published. During the next few months Otis Nichols supervised the publication of a chart that was advertised for distribution and sale in January 1851. “We are much pleased with the arrangement of the Chart,” wrote James White, “… and we are satisfied that it will be a great help to those who teach the present truth.”\nSee: Ellen G.

But the words which were considered the most sinful she did not speak.23 Further details of the incident mentioned here are given by Ellen White in Spiritual Gifts and by John Loughborough, who was an eyewitness to some of the events. Central to the episode was an angry outburst by Abigail Palmer of the Jackson, Michigan, band, aimed at a non-Adventist neighbor. Witnessing the scene was 17-year-old Savilla, daughter of Hiram Case, who claimed (according to Loughborough) that the offensive word “bitch” had been used. Hiram Case and Charles Russell insisted that Abigail Palmer should confess, but she denied using the vile epithet. The Jackson group became divided on the issue. Sometime thereafter, in early June 1853, the Whites visited Jackson, and Ellen was given the vision that is here reported. Abigail subsequently admitted to having used the word “witch” rather than “bitch.”\nSee: Ellen G. White, Spiritual Gifts [vol. 2], pp. 181, 182; J. N.

I tried to write out the vision to the church in a careful manner, and get it before the brethren in its true light.2 Ellen White here begins a discussion of the state of the Sabbatarian Adventists in Jackson, Michigan. Although she had received a vision relating to the Jackson band one year earlier (June 1852) the vision mentioned here is clearly of more recent origin. When the Whites visited Jackson a few weeks earlier, they had found the group deeply divided over accusations that Abigail Palmer had spoken offensively to a nonmember, with Hiram Case and Charles Russell being foremost among the accusers. According to one account, “these two men had succeeded in dividing the church so that they then held no public meetings.” While there, on June 2, Ellen White was instructed in vision not only concerning the Palmer case but also about other problems within the Jackson band and with several of its leading members. The vision mentioned here is no doubt the June 2 vision as recorded in Ms 1, 1853.\nSee: Ellen G. White, Lt 2, 1852 (June 2); idem, Ms 1, 1853 (June 2); “The Advent Harbinger,” Review, July 4, 1854, p. 173.

It is well known that Hiram Case and Charles Russell, both of whom were reproved in the June 2 vision, were disfellowshipped and subsequently formed the opposition Messenger Party. Russell apparently was excluded from fellowship within a matter of weeks, but for Hiram Case separation was a drawn-out process. For one thing, Ellen White made a special appeal to Case some weeks after the vision in this letter of June 29. “Dear Brother Case, make thorough work. Dig deep and confess from the bottom.” For a while Case responded positively. In August he even made public confession in a letter to the Review editor. “I have done wrong in using the Lord's money as I should not. … I do deeply regret, and humbly ask the forgiveness of all my brethren and sisters.” However, events subsequently took a turn for the worse, and on February 17, 1854, leading Michigan brethren decided that “we no longer consider him [Case] qualified to travel and teach the third angel's message.” (According to J. B. Bezzo, that decision had already been made in Sylvan, Michigan, in January 1854, with fellowship being withdrawn from Case “a short time after.”)\nApart from Case and Russell there were other casualties. The incident involving the alleged offensive language of Abigail Palmer continued to fester in the Jackson band even after Ellen White was shown in vision on June 2, 1853, that Mrs. Palmer did not use the epithet she was accused of using (see Ms 1, 1853). Savilla Case, 17-year-old daughter of Hiram Case, who had originated the accusation, at first acknowledged the truth of the vision but subsequently retracted her confession, insisting that the vision “was false” (see Morrill). What had begun in 1853 as a disagreement over church discipline soon developed into a full-scale division among the members over the authority of Ellen White's visions. The exact extent of the revolt in Jackson against the visions is not known, but several names (in addition to Case and Russell) are mentioned in the Messenger of Truth, including “Sr. Eliza Smith,” “Sr. Knight,” and “Sister Morrill.” In nearby Sylvan, Michigan, 19 members in a joint letter to the Messenger of Truth declared that they had “no confidence in the visions of E. G. White” and were withdrawing from the fellowship of the Sylvan band.\nSee: “The Advent Harbinger,” Review, July 4, 1854, p. 173; H. S. Case, “From Bro. Case,” Review, Aug. 18, 1853, p. 64; “H. S.

New places must be entered, and when new places are entered, it would be well to go two and two so as to hold up the hands of each other, whenever they can consistently and not neglect other places.2 The practice of ministers going out two by two in public evangelism was sometimes followed before this time, but with the beginnings of tent evangelism the following summer (1854) it seemed to become the rule that it should not be a solo effort but involve two or more ministers. From the 1880s and onward Ellen White frequently urged those engaging in public evangelism, including colporteurs, to work in teams of two, with the motivation given that this was the method of Christ. “Calling the twelve about Him, Jesus bade them go out two and two. … None were sent forth alone. … In our own time evangelistic work would be far more successful if this example were more closely followed” (The Desire of Ages, p. 350).\nSee: Search terms “tent meeting,” “tent meetings,” in Words of the Pioneers; Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 350. For extracts from Ellen G. White's writings recommending team evangelism, see section “Advantages of Two and Two,” in Ellen G. White, Evangelism, pp. 72-74. I saw that the brethren must not go over and over through the same field of labor, but must be hunting out souls in new places, setting the truth before those who are not now enlightened as to our present position.3 A conspicuous example of following this instruction can be seen in the shift of focus of evangelism from East to West starting in the mid-1850s. James White expressed the principle behind this shift in 1857: “We have labored in the East and in the West, and speak the things we know. And no consideration whatever, excepting a sense of positive duty, could induce us at present to labor on the gospel-hardened shores of New England, while so much can be done in the wide West.”\nSee: [James White], “Moving West,” Review, May 7, 1857, p. 5."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 376","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

White, Ms 3, 1853 (July 2); Ms 4, 1853 (July 2); idem, Supplement to the Christian Experience and Views of Ellen G. White, pp. 14, 22, 23, 35, 38, 45 (Early Writings, pp. 95, 96, 114, 115, 117, 118, 124, 125). many things were explained to us which we did not understand and which were necessary for us to know. I saw that we must have the truth got out oftener—that the only paper in the land owned and approved of God should come out oftener than once in two weeks, while papers that are full of error come out weekly and some oftener than that.4 The idea of publishing the Review weekly rather than twice monthly had been raised in its columns several times during the previous two years and had been generally well received. No decision had been taken because of the financial implications and, as R. F. Cottrell pointed out, there was the question of whether sufficient quality articles would be submitted to sustain a weekly. It seems that the confirmation provided by this July 2 vision caused James White, as editor, to decide to go weekly. A few days later, in the July 7, 1853, Review, James White declared: “we are fully satisfied that the time has come when it [the Review] should be issued [weekly]. … We shall probably be able to commence about the first of August, if our readers send the means to commence with.”\nSee: “The Review Weekly,” Review, July 7, 1853, p. 32.

By June 1853 Russell was deeply involved in an imbroglio involving Abigail Palmer in which he showed great severity.

As early as 1849 Ellen White had reproved Joseph Bates for advising members to sell their property immediately, even at a loss, to support the work. In the June 2 vision a prominent preacher, Samuel W. Rhodes, was admonished for giving similar extreme counsel. “Wrong impressions were given [by Rhodes] concerning the brethren's property, as though it was a burden to them, and they must get it off their hands as soon as possible.”\nSee: Ms 14, 1850 (Sept.), note 5; Ellen G.

Apart from the well-known Cyrenius Smith family (including his wife, Louisa, and son William) there are references to “E. Smith,” “L. Smith,” and “Eliza Smith” in Jackson.

The only hint as to its full identity is found in the December letter. “Tell Sister C. Smith I thank her for her present.

James White's “sinking” feelings and tendency to look on “the dark side” led him to write some uncharacteristically self-pitying lines to “Brother Abraham” on July 31: “This moment most of my whole frame is in pain—worn out—while others go in ease, free from care. … I sometimes fear I shall murmur and be lost. Oh, that God would work, I will be reconciled. … If I die, don't weep for me but for those whose course has worn me out.”\nSee: James White to Abram Dodge, July 31, 1853.

The most recent recruit had been Uriah Smith, who had joined the staff some weeks earlier on May 3, 1853, and who would rise to the position of resident editor before the end of 1855. His sister, Annie R. Smith, had joined the staff already in 1851. “She is just the help we need,” wrote Ellen White. “She takes right hold with James and helps him much.

Hiram Drew was disfellowshipped sometime during the winter of 1853/1854.\nThere were several problematic aspects to Case and Russell's relation to the Sabbatarian Adventists. But the precipitating factor that subsequently led to their expulsion seems to have been their concerted and public campaign against the visions after they were reproved in a vision in June 1853 for their severity against Mrs. Palmer. Russell later claimed that he was disfellowshipped “because I do not believe the visions,” and his supporters, such as A. N. Seymour, alleged that “the Sabbatarians made the visions of Ellen White a test of fellowship.” Yet the records suggest that Case and Russell did much more than simply disbelieve the visions; they launched a divisive campaign against the visions and against the leadership of James White. A Review editorial later maintained that “the vision [of June 1853] was not made a test of fellowship. These men were disfellowshipped on account of their unchristian conduct.”\nSee: “The Advent Harbinger,” Review, July 4, 1854, p. 173; A. N.

All three specifications fit well with Hiram Drew, a Sabbatarian Adventist from Jackson County who was disfellowshipped from the band in Sylvan, Michigan (15 miles [24 kilometers] from Jackson), some months later. Drew subsequently joined Case and Russell in the breakaway Messenger Party.\nSee: EGWEnc, s.v. “Messenger Party”; J. B. Bezzo, “Test of Fellowship,” Messenger of Truth, Oct. 19, 1854, pp. [2, 3].

Apart from the well-known Cyrenius Smith family (including his wife, Louisa, and son William) there are references to “E. Smith,” “L. Smith,” and “Eliza Smith” in Jackson.

The only hint as to its full identity is found in the December letter. “Tell Sister C. Smith I thank her for her present.

How it will turn with him I cannot tell. Perhaps he will receive it, and it may be he will sink down beneath it.14 In a vision given two months earlier, on June 2, Samuel W. Rhodes's “overbearing spirit” and severity had been pointed out together with the harmful effect this had had on the congregations he visited. In addition he was reproved for his extreme teaching that members with lands and houses should sell as soon as possible in order to support the young movement. It seems that in these closing lines Ellen White is wondering how Rhodes had reacted to this testimony of reproof. Would he “receive it” positively, or would he, like Case and Russell, “sink down” and reject the testimony? James White, writing a few days earlier, on July 31, also to the Dodges, hoped that “Brother Rhodes will make straight work confessing. … He has only admitted the vision to me.” The August 11 issue of the Review did in fact carry a public confession from Rhodes. “I see some things … which call for a confession on my part, which indeed is humiliating but shall be freely and frankly made. … I have not at all times possessed enough of the mind of Christ and have been left to a hurried, overbearing, oppressive spirit, and to deal out rebukes sometimes that were not dictated by the Spirit of the Lord.” Some months later (Dec. 28) James wrote that “Brother Rhodes … is trying to get right.”\nSee: Ellen G.

Apart from the well-known Cyrenius Smith family (including his wife, Louisa, and son William), there are references to “E. Smith,” “L. Smith,” and “Eliza Smith” in Jackson. Ellen White mentions a Smith family in Jackson in four letters written between July and December 1853 in a way that suggests that in all four she is referring to the same family. The only hint as to their full identity is found in the December letter. “Tell Sister C. Smith I thank her for her present. Much love to her and all that family.” This may well be a reference to Sister Cyrenius Smith and gives some reason for identifying “Bro. Smith” here as Cyrenius Smith.

James White echoed the sentiments of this passage in a series of articles the same month entitled “Gospel Order.” “He who enters upon the work of the gospel ministry must be called of God, a man of experience.”\nSee: “Gospel Order,” Review, Dec. 13, 1853, p. 180. For a detailed study of steps taken to license ministers and wider aspects of church organization, see Andrew Gordon Mustard, James White and SDA Organization. I might mention individual cases. Brother Lothrop [Howard Lothrop]6 Identity: The only Lothrop mentioned in the Review from this period who is identified as a preacher is Howard Lothrop, of Eaton, Canada East. In 1852 and 1853 Lothrop reported in letters to the Review of his preaching itineraries, the most extensive of which took him from Canada through Vermont and Massachusetts to Rhode Island and back to Canada in the winter of 1851-1852.\nSee: Howard Lothrop, “From Bro. Lothrop,” Review, Mar. 2, 1852, p. 102; search term “Lothrop” in Words of the Pioneers. is one that was shown me. His influence has been bad in many places. He has thought too much of himself, when he had but little judgment.7 One year earlier, in October 1852, Ellen White had written of Howard Lothrop that he “had traveled too extensively and was too self-sufficient. … Repeatedly Brother Lothrop would get up and talk until he would talk the Spirit all away from the meeting.” Lothrop subsequently broke away from the Sabbatarian Adventists and, according to James White, “went in full fury with the Messenger spirits against us and the Review.”\nSee: Ellen G. White, Lt 4, 1852 (Oct. 25); James White, “Organization,” Review, Aug. 27, 1861, p. 100. Towle [John R. Towle] and Eastman [Ezra Eastman]8 Identity: “Towle and Eastman,” of whom we are told that they were preachers “whom God had never sent,” are no doubt the J. R. Towle and Ezra Eastman, who had been upbraided some weeks earlier at a conference in Vermont. “The brethren felt it their duty,” it was reported in the Review, “to express their opinion relative to Ezra Eastman and J. R. Towle, who profess to observe the Sabbath, and teach the present truth. … All were agreed … that they do not consider them proper persons to teach the present truth.” This is the only mention of “Ezra Eastman” in the Review during the 1850s. Nothing is known for certain about him other than what is found in this notice. However, more clues as to J. R. Towle's full identity are available. Of particular significance is Towle's mention in the Review that his father-in-law's name was Joseph Brooks and the fact that several of his letters were written from Canaan, New Hampshire. Genealogical sources chronicle the marriage of “J. R. Towle” to “Mary M. Brooks” in Canaan, New Hampshire, in 1834, and amplify “J. R.” to “John R.”\nSee: James White, “Appointments,” Review, Oct. 25, 1853, p. 128; “Eastern Tour,” Review, Nov. 15, 1853, pp. 148, 149; search term “Towle” in Words of the Pioneers. were others whom God had never sent, and who were only a curse to the cause.

The only Baker in the early 1850s identified as a preacher is Joseph Baker, of Lebanon, New Hampshire. The additional information given that he has been “too cautious, moved too slowly” is confirmed in available sources. Although an active preacher in 1851 and 1852, by 1853 little is reported of his activities. By October 1853 James White expressed regret that “our dear Bro. Baker has been in the field but little.” After 1854 Baker dropped out of the workforce.\nSee: James White, “Eastern Tour,” Review, Oct. 4, 1853, p. 104; search term “Baker” in Words of the Pioneers.

There was not that kind, courteous feeling cherished by some of the brethren that there ought to be. There is too much severity used when it is not timely or when the mind is not prepared for it. Some reprove unwisely and others are too backward, and let things go on that God is displeased with, and not rebuke or reprove them. I did see that Brother Hart11 Identity: Insufficient information is available to determine which of several possible Harts is referred to here. had pressed the abstinence of herbs in case of sickness too far. I saw that it was right to use herbs that are beneficial for the use of man, but the poisonous herbs—tobacco, etc.—it was not right to use, because it was injuring and breaking down the constitution, weakening the system, ruining the nerves, and clogging and destroying the mind and reasoning powers which God has given us to serve Him with, that with the mind we may serve the law of God and adore and honor our Creator. I saw that others had erred in the same way, but the particular individuals I did not see or cannot recollect of seeing.12 In addition to “Brother Hart” Ellen White might have mentioned Luman Masten, who had taken a similarly uncompromising stand two months earlier in a letter to the Review. Speaking of medicinal “roots and herbs” Masten exclaimed, “Let such as have no faith use them!” The more moderate approach to herbal remedies indicated in this vision of December 1853 had apparently been the practice of the Whites all along. In 1848, for example, they “had used simple herbs” when their baby Henry was sick, although “they had no effect.”\nSee: Ellen G. White, Spiritual Gifts [vol. 2], p. 104. For an earlier statement by Ellen White against the use of tobacco, see Lt 5, 1851 (Dec. 14).

God has shown me those who keep God's commandments [are] to have nothing to do in praying for the sick of those who are daily trampling them underfoot, unless it is in some special case where souls are convicted of the truth and are decided to move out upon it. The partition wall between commandment keepers and those who trample them underfoot should be kept up.14 Throughout her writings Ellen White appeals to the principles found in James 5:14-16 when praying for the sick. Prayer for healing is not to be undertaken lightly or indiscriminately but in the context of faith, confession of sin, and the sincere purpose of the sick person to live in accordance with the will of God. The will of God encompasses both the moral law and the laws of health. Prayer will not benefit the one who is willfully transgressing God's commandments. Ellen White draws out this distinction in her response to Pierce's inquiry. That this does not mean that prayers for healing should be undertaken only for Seventh-day Adventist members is clearly illustrated elsewhere in Ellen White's personal example and teaching. See, for example, the encouragement she gives to nurses and doctors at Seventh-day Adventist medical institutions to pray with, and give spiritual counsel to, patients not of that faith or even of any faith, again within the guidelines given in James 5.\nFor a fuller discussion of these principles by Ellen White, see Counsels on Health, pp. 373, 374, Medical Ministry, pp. 246-248, The Ministry of Healing, pp. 144, 145, 225-233, and Prayer, pp. 225-237."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 393.3","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Washing feet and the Lord's supper should be more frequently practiced by us.6 For the transition from a sporadic observance of the ordinances in the 1840s and 1850s toward a quarterly observance in the 1860s and beyond, see Roger H. Ferris, “The Ordinances of Foot-Washing and the Lord's Supper in the Seventh-day Adventist Denomination,” pp. 28, 29, 42, 46. Jesus set us the example and told us to do as He had done to us. I saw that the example of Christ should be as exactly followed as possible. Yet brethren and sisters have not always moved as judiciously as they should in washing feet, and confusion has been caused. I saw that the messengers of God must be careful how they introduce this duty. I saw that no example was given us in God's Word for the brethren to wash the sisters’ feet, but there was an example of the sisters washing their brethren's feet.7 Should this passage on intergender foot washing be taken as implying that it was common practice among Sabbatarian Adventists in the early 1850s for men to wash the feet of women and vice versa? Does the passage constitute instruction radically curtailing such practices? There are only a handful of reports in the Review, during this period, of the foot-washing ceremony being observed, and none of them describe how it was carried out. It seems unlikely, however, that mixed gender washing, particularly men washing the feet of women, was a common feature. Such a practice was considered scandalous and had raised a hue and cry in both the secular and religious press during 1845-1846, when some Millerite factions had adopted “promiscuous” (i.e., mixed) foot washing. It seems more than likely that if mixed gender washing had been a common feature of Sabbatarian Adventism in the early 1850s it would have been highlighted by critics of the movement. Although no comprehensive study has been done of early critics of the Sabbatarian Adventists, random reading of this literature has not uncovered accusations of such practice.\nAn alternative interpretation of this passage is that Ellen White is primarily addressing those who argued that foot washing per se was an unbiblical practice. According to one such argument, as set out here by B. Mathewson in 1858, “in Christ Jesus ‘there is neither male nor female. … Where is one example where Christ ever separated the sexes for worship or the performance of an ordinance?” Hence, he argues, “there can be no impropriety for the sexes to engage … promiscuously … in the ordinance of the Lord's supper.” And yet, as “all must see,” such a mixed service “would have an appearance of evil” and “be a great source of scandal to the church.” The inescapable conclusion is that Christ never intended foot washing as a general ordinance. To this kind of argument James White responded some years later, in 1859: “We reply that confining ourselves strictly to the example set us in the sacred record involves no breach of propriety. We have the examples of females washing the feet of males, but not vice versa.” James White's counterargument clearly echoed the position found in this 1853 letter by Ellen White.\nFor a history of the ordinance of foot washing among Seventh-day Adventists, see Roger H. Ferris, “The Ordinances of Foot Washing and the Lord's Supper in the Seventh-day Adventist Denomination.” For examples of contemporary critics of foot washing as an ordinance, see B. Mathewson, “Some Reasons for Not Practicing Feet Washing as a Religious Ordinance,” The World's Crisis, Sept. 8, 1858, p. 4; L. H. Chase, “Feet-Washing,” Advent Harbinger, Sept. 24, 1853, pp. 114, 115. James White's response to Mathewson is found in “Feet-Washing,” Review, Feb. 24, 1859, p. 108. For reactions to mixed gender foot washing in 1845-1846, see George R. Knight, Millennial Fever, pp. 251, 252, and David Tallmadge Arthur, “‘Come Out of Babylon,’” pp. 116-119; EGWEnc, s.v. “Lord's Supper.” Mary washed the Saviour's feet with her tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head. Also the widow who is mentioned. If she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints’ feet. I saw that God had moved upon the sisters to wash the brethren's feet and it was according to the gospel order and would glorify God when He laid this cross upon them and it would humble the one that performed it. All, I saw, should move in this thing understandingly and not make the washing of feet a tedious ceremony."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 397.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

White, “Duty of Parents to Their Children,” Review, Sept. 19, 1854, pp. 45, 46. unless you speedily turn square about and be faithful to your children. Think you that God can cover or hide iniquity in children and preserve them whom He hates? No, never. God hates unruly children19 When Ellen White edited this statement for publication in the Review seven months later, she rephrased it to read that God “cannot love unruly children who manifest passion.” This statement, together with the warning to her 5-year-old son in 1860 that “wicked, naughty children God does not love” (Lt 3, 1860 [Mar. 14]), have been the subject of considerable discussion. Critics have asked, “How could someone who claimed to receive heavenly visions be so terribly wrong about the character of God?” Others, while agreeing that these early statements do not seem to express accurately God's loving attitude, have argued that Ellen White grew in her perception of God's character, and that this is evidenced in her later writings.\nIt is difficult to reconcile this thesis of a harsh “early” Ellen White with the very different picture of her that is revealed in many other statements from her pen during the same period that deal with God's attitude toward wayward children. All the following extracts are taken from Ellen White articles published in the 1850s in the Youth's Instructor, a paper for children and youth:\n1. “Dear young friends, your case is not now hopeless. Jesus so loved you that He died for your sins” (January 1854, p. 6).\n2. “He knows your weakness, and is ready to have compassion upon you, although you may have sinned much against Him” (May 1854, p. 38).\n3. “Oh, what love! what unbounded love and condescension the Son of God manifested for us. He died to give life to those who were His enemies!” (January 1854, p. 5).\n4. “All heaven is interested in your salvation. God has given His only beloved Son to die for your transgression, angels are watching over you, and are trying to turn your attention to God, to seek your soul's salvation” (December 1852, p. 20).\nStatements such as these portray the love of God in the sense of His benevolence, His intense desire for the well-being of sinful, rebellious children and youth. However, another standard dictionary definition of “love” (in its verbal form) is “to be pleased with” something or somebody. Clearly God does not take pleasure in children or any persons when they engage in evil, wicked acts. This aspect of God's disfavor is expressed in Scripture in such passages as Psalm 11:5: “The Lord tests the righteous, but the wicked and the one who loves violence His soul hates” (NKJV). This would seem to be the most likely sense of the terms “hate” and “love” used by Ellen White when she writes that God does not love wicked, naughty children. The same thought, expressed differently, is found in the following appeal to a young person: “How can you rest, knowing that Jesus does not smile upon you … , because you reject offered mercy, and sin against Him every hour?” (Youth's Instructor, January 1854, p. 5).\nUnderstood in this light, Ellen White's language here (and in Lt 3, 1860) is misconstrued if it is made to conflict with her other statements from the same period affirming God's love for erring youth. But the risk of miscommunicating this fundamental truth underscores Ellen White's later admonition to parents to articulate clearly the distinction between God's displeasure with the rebellious and His merciful love that seeks to bring such ones to Himself:\n[Jesus] would have [the fathers and mothers] teach their children that God loves them, that their natures may be changed, and brought into harmony with God. Do not teach your children that God does not love them when they do wrong; teach them that He loves them so that it grieves His tender Spirit to see them in transgression, because He knows they are doing injury to their souls. Do not terrify your children by telling them of the wrath of God, but rather seek to impress them with His unspeakable love and goodness, and thus let the glory of the Lord be revealed before them.—Signs of the Times, Feb. 15, 1892, p. 231.\nFor additional viewpoints on this issue, see Herbert E. Douglass, Messenger of the Lord, pp. 59, 60; Alden Thompson, Escape From the Flames, pp. 146-149; Jerry Moon, W. C. White and Ellen G. White, pp. 36-41. who manifest passion and evil tempers, etc. He cannot save them in the time of trouble. They will be eternally lost through parents’ neglect.20 The question of the destiny of children who die before reaching “the age of accountability” has been an unsettled issue among Christians. It receives only passing mention in the writings of Ellen White, perhaps the most substantial treatment being in Selected Messages, book 3, pp. 313-315. No major analyses of Ellen White's position on infant salvation have been published. For partial studies, see Alberto R.

You may as well violate the Sabbath yourselves as to let your children do it. If you suffer your children to play upon the Sabbath,22 Even children can be taught the concept of Sabbath holiness. In an article written for children and young people in 1853 Ellen White appealed to them through the words of Isaiah to turn “from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, … not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure” (Isa. 58:13). “Dear children,” she urged, “are you as careful as you should be in keeping the Sabbath?”\nBeyond the avoidance of behavior disruptive to the spirit of the Sabbath, Ellen White elsewhere encouraged parents to make Sabbath “the most interesting day of the week” for their children, adding, “How can children receive a more correct knowledge of God, and their minds be better impressed, than in spending a portion of their time out of doors, not in play, but in company with their parents?”\nSee: Ellen G. White, “Keep the Sabbath Holy,” Youth's Instructor, February 1853, p. 37; idem, “How Shall We Keep the Sabbath?” Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2, pp. 582-585. For Ellen White's general counsel on children and the Sabbath, see Child Guidance, pp. 527-537. God looks upon you as Sabbath breakers, or commandment breakers.23 Ellen White may be referring not only to the general principle of parental responsibility but also to the specific demands of the fourth commandment, which holds the head of a household responsible to see that sons, daughters, employees, and even guests be given Sabbath privileges. James White made this specific point two years later: “God's law requires that all who remain in our dwellings should join in observing the rest of the holy Sabbath. We may endeavor to keep the Sabbath, yet if our children are left to break it, the sin will fall on us.”\nSee: J. W. [James White], “Nor Thy Stranger That Is Within Thy Gates,” Review, Dec. 11, 1856, p. 45. Your children should be made to mind you. Your word should be their law.

To the motivation given for avoiding such items, that they were destructive of health and were a waste of money that “should be put in the treasury of the Lord,” was added the concept of the connection between spirituality and physical health.

The terms “spiritual magnetism,” “animal magnetism,” and “mesmerism” are found in her early work, with “hypnotism” being introduced by the turn of the century. The terms “animal magnetism” and “mesmerism” were used interchangeably in the literature of the late eighteenth and ninteenth centuries. Widespread public interest in mesmerism in North America had been awakened by the public demonstrations of Charles Poyen de Saint Sauveur in 1836. By the 1840s hundreds of lecturers, including a number of clergy, toured the country inducing mesmeric trances in front of fascinated audiences. Like “Brother Thompson” (see note 7 below), some associated the hypnotic trance with religious phenomena. La Roy Sunderland, a Methodist clergyman, emphasized the similarities between hypnotically induced trances and the swooning, prostration, and visionary experiences of early-nineteenth-century Methodist revival meetings.\nSee: EGWEnc, s.v. “Hypnotism”; Ann Taves, Fits, Trances, & Visions, pp. 132-148. and called it the Spirit of God.

One wonders if Ellen White is referring to Jesse Thompson, of Ballston Spa, New York, of whom she had written in 1851. However, there is no intimation in the 1851 documents or in references to Jesse Thompson in the Review that he was involved in the kind of problems brought up here. He is given only positive mentions—a generous contributor, conferences held in his house, etc. But there is one indication that Jesse Thompson may have reached a crisis in his relation to the Sabbatarian Adventists by early 1854. This is the fact that after fairly frequent references to Thompson in the Review between 1851 and 1853, nothing is heard of him after February 7, 1854 (very close to the February 12, 1854, date of the manuscript), nor does his obituary appear in the Review in 1858.

I saw that Brother Thompson had formerly been affected with spiritualism8 Thompson's involvement in both mesmerism and spiritualism was not unusual. As historian Ann Taves has noted of this period: “Spiritualists frequently were involved with mesmerism, either as mesmerizers or as mesmeric subjects, before and after becoming Spiritualists.” The basic hypothesis uniting the two practices was that the hypnotic trance “could provide access to the spirit realm.”\nSee: Ann Taves, Fits, Trances, & Visions, pp. 168, 166. and never had had it eradicated from him.

I was shown the low state of the brethren; the ark of God was gone out of the camp.3 An allusion to the ark of the ancient Hebrew sanctuary, a symbol of God's presence in the camp of the Israelites. Compare the language used here with the following passage in Ms 1, 1854 (Feb. 12): “A death-like stupor has hung upon the people of God. The reason is, the ark is not with them, for the holy commandments have been broken, and God has taken it away in His anger.” I was shown that a right influence had not been exerted by Bro. Rhodes [Samuel W. Rhodes];4 Identity: For several reasons it seems clear that Samuel W. Rhodes is being referred to: his inclusion among “the lecturing brethren,” the reproof for his severity, and his influence on the Lincklaen group. S. W. Rhodes, a well-known traveling preacher in the 1850s, had, according to Review accounts, made at least five visits to the Lincklaen believers prior to this. Regarding his severity, see note 5, below.\nSee: Bro. Rhodes, “Extracts of Letters,” Review, Aug. 19, 1851, p. 16; “Conference at Bath, N. Y.,” Review, Sept. 16, 1851, p. 32; E. A. Poole, “From Bro.

Rhodes, “Appointments,” Review, Jan. 6, 1853, p. 136. a good example has not been set, and darkness and weakness has been the consequence. I saw that Bro. R. had possessed an overbearing spirit in this vicinity,5 Eight months earlier, on June 2, 1853, Rhodes's harshness and overbearing manner had been the focus of Ms 1, 1853 (June 2). He apparently accepted the reproof, as evidenced by a letter to the Review some weeks later in which he confessed to an “overbearing, oppressive spirit.” Little seemed to have changed in the long run, however, since Ellen White returned to Rhodes's problems in this area in several letters written in the 1850s and 1860s. See, for example Lt 8, 1857 (July 19); Lt 16, 1859 (Oct. 28); Lt 5a, 1861 (Apr. 5); Lt 4, 1870 (Mar. 23). For Rhodes's letter of confession in 1853, see S. W. Rhodes, “Letter From Bro. Rhodes,” Review, Aug. 11, 1853, p. 55. and has often hurt the oil and wine,6 An expression borrowed from Revelation 6:6. has misjudged individuals, and has laid burdens upon them that did not belong to them. I saw that this has been done in the case of Brother and Sister Poole [Ezra A. and Sally Marilla Poole].7 Identity: The only “Poole” mentioned in the Review before 1858 is “Bro. E. A. Poole.” His address is given as Lincklaen, New York. The address matches the opening line of this manuscript, which places the persons and events “in Lincklaen and vicinity.” His first name, Ezra, and the name of his wife can be found in census sources.\nSee: Search term “Poole” in Words of the Pioneers; 1860 U.S. Federal Census, “Ezra A. Poole,” New York, Chenango County, Lincklaen, p. 215; 1880 U.S. Federal Census, “Ezra A. Poole,” New York, Chenango County, Lincklaen, p. 148A.

It has borne but with a feather's weight. I saw that straight testimonies must be borne, and they have not been received. I then saw that the church must be united, and if they could not endure straight testimonies when they were needed and we were bound, we must move the office and go where we could bear them.1 By April 1854, the date of this manuscript, opposition to the visions of Ellen White among a small minority of Sabbatarian Adventists was developing and would soon result in the formation of the breakaway Messenger Party. However, the focus of this vision seems to be not on external challenges but on opposition from within, specifically in the Rochester area, where the “office” was located from 1852 to 1855. Ellen White later specified certain names: “Brn. Lamson, Orton, and Andrews, and the Stevens family,” who “felt justified to array themselves against us.” That J. N. Andrews is mentioned is, perhaps, surprising, given his later stature in the church. Still in his early 20s he had already made his mark as a scholar, writer, and itinerant preacher. Andrews, however, tended to undermine the Whites by siding with those who were admonished. As he later confessed, “sympathy for my immediate friends when reproved for their wrongs has been one great cause of leading me into the dark.” The mention of “the Stevens family” is no doubt a reference to Harriet N. Stevens, a young woman of literary bent from Paris, Maine, who joined the Review staff in 1854 or 1855. Writing to Harriet some years later, in 1860, Ellen White asserted that “the visions” “do not bear a feather's weight on your mind” and that she had shown the same attitude while employed in Rochester. Further, if someone was admonished or reproved by the Whites, “you sympathize with him, confide in him,” thus undermining their leadership. Significantly, both J. N. Andrews and Harriet Stevens came from Paris, Maine, where the parents of both maintained a skeptical attitude toward the visions throughout the 1850s.\nSee: Ellen G. White, Lt 7, 1860 (June); idem, Testimony to the Church at Battle Creek (1872) (PH123), pp. 72, 73; J. N. Andrews to Brother White, Feb. 2, 1862; Ron Graybill, “The Family Man,” in Harry Leonard, ed., J. N. Andrews: The Man and the Mission, pp. 24-28; Gerald Wheeler, James White, pp. 101-109. I saw that we neither of us had done our duty. There has been a holding back, a shunning to declare the whole counsel of God. I saw that God wanted us to be free, that if we did not follow the movings of His Spirit and bear the testimonies He gave us,2 The specific inclusion of James White here brings out the fact that Ellen is speaking of opposition not only to her visions but also to the work of James. In a letter written in 1860 she wrote very frankly about the situation created by “the straight testimony and reproofs given by Brother White” through the years. Looking back to their time in Paris, Maine, 1850-1851, she acknowledged that “the feelings then were that James was censorious and severe” and that similar feelings had been held by some during the years in Rochester, New York (1852-1855). However, Ellen White held that the reproofs given in Paris “were no more than the case deserved.” Moreover, “when they were reproved, instead of carefully searching their own heart and confessing their ways, self rose right up [and they said], ‘It can't be so.’” She recognized that “Brother White is not perfect. In the ardor of his feelings he may speak too strongly,” but pled that those affected discuss the matter with him personally rather than spread rancor among others.\nSee: Ellen G. White, Lt 8, 1860 (June 11). He would leave us in bondage and then our health and strength would fail, and worse than all this, the bondage would be felt on the people, and if there is not freedom and liberty here, we must move where there would be freedom and where the testimonies given us of God would be received. I saw that some had doubted what God had taught, therefore it could not have weight with them or serve to move them. I saw this, and begged of God to use another instrument, to send by one whom they would receive, or to fit up the frail instrument that the church might be convinced. Said the angel, God has chosen His own way, that through the simple means He has ordained that light should be given, and if it is not received God will give them up to their own ways to be filled with their own doing."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 427","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Parents have much to do in this matter, and by subduing or correcting their children can lessen the power of the evil angels upon them and after they have done this duty, they can then bring their children to God, and in the name of Jesus claim His blessing upon them. But God is dishonored and insulted when parents bring their children to Him unsubdued and unconverted, with all their evil tempers and passions, and ask Him to work for them.

Parents, the Lord has shown me that if you wish to save your children, separate them from the world, keep them from other wicked children.4 The analogy between the separation of believers’ children from “the world” and the separation of ancient Israelites from the Egyptians at the time of the tenth plague is clarified by Ellen White in 3SG 224: “In order to escape the great judgment of God which He was to bring upon the Egyptians, the token of blood must be seen upon their houses. And they were required to separate themselves and their children from the Egyptians, and gather them into their own houses, for if any of the Israelites were found in the houses of the Egyptians, they would fall by the hand of the destroying angel.” Subdue their tempers and evil passions; teach them to obey you; then they can more easily obey the commandments of God. After you have done your duty, carry your children to God and plead His blessing upon them, and He that said, “Suffer little children to come unto Me and forbid them not” will be ready to listen to your prayers for them, and the seal or mark of the believing parents will cover the children if they are brought up right.5 This passage appears to deal with the destiny of children below the age of accountability. Just as protection was afforded the firstborn children of believing Israelites during the tenth plague, so in the future final crisis the “mark of the believing parents will cover the children if they are brought up aright.” The parallel is brought out clearly in Manuscript 26, 1885 (Oct. 22): Asked whether “the little children of … believing parents would be saved,” Ellen White responded, “The faith of the believing parents covers the children, as when God sent His judgments upon the first-born of the Egyptians.”\nThe question of the destiny of children who die before reaching “the age of accountability” has been an unsettled issue among Christians. It receives only passing mention in the writings of Ellen White, perhaps the most substantial treatment being in Selected Messages, book 3, pp. 313-315. No major analyses of Ellen White's position on infant salvation have been published. For partial studies, see Alberto R. Timm, in Revistra do Ancião (Brazil), October-December 2006, p. 7; Edwin Harry Zackrison, “Seventh-day Adventists and Original Sin,” pp. 247, 248, 366-371; Woodrow W. Whidden II, “The Soteriology of Ellen G. White,” pp. 130-132; Jairyong Lee, “Faith and Works in Ellen G. White's Doctrine of the Last Judgment,” pp. 328-330. If parents neglect their duty, and leave their children to indulge in wicked, evil passions, the destroying angel will cut them down, and you parents will have an awful account to give for the neglect of your children. You who have not done your duty, now awake and redeem the time. It is but short, but you can work faithfully and can do much for your children.

That this is not the case is seen in other documents from the same period.

Even more specifically, a good case can be made for a June/July 1854 date. At this time Ellen White mentioned that she had written to “the band in Bedford” to relate a vision (Lt 7, 1854 [July]). This vision, as argued earlier (Lt 7, 1854, note 3), was given in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on June 18.

They are listed for that township in 1850 but not in 1860 or in subsequent censuses. By 1860 Mary had died, and Seley had moved from Bedford. Further, both “S.

In this time we have traveled and labored in the churches about one third of the time. This amount of care and labor, together with protracted sickness and deaths in our family, has brought us very near the grave. In this prostrated condition we have been saddened with pecuniary embarrassment, and the unreasonableness of “false brethren.” Our usual hours of confinement to our business in past time have been from 14 to 18 out of the 24.

I made a visit to Mill Grove [New York], and have but just returned. We are as well as usual. Baby weighs 19 pounds [8.6 kilograms], is a fat, healthy boy, perfectly good-natured, seldom cries. My health is quite good except a trouble of bloating which makes me feel unpleasant. I weigh 150 pounds [68 kilograms]. I am very grateful to the friends for their donations to me. I will try to use it just right, knowing it is the Lord's money. You thought of sending a box of dried fruit; it would come very acceptably. Can you get some spikenard? [You] need not preserve it in sugar; send it dry. James ate a part of that you sent to poor Anna and thought it did him good. Many of our friends recommend a constant use of it to James as very healing and useful for the lungs.7 American spikenard was a traditional frontier remedy in the old Northwest. According to John Caruso, “The prescription for pneumonia was the same as that of any cough: large quantities of a syrup consisting principally of spikenard and elecampane.”\nThat Ellen White is seeking for an herbal remedy for James's sickness (in addition to the daily prayer sessions mentioned earlier in the letter) may seem anomalous given the many accounts of faith healings among Sabbatarian Adventists from the earliest days of the movement. Clearly, however, the Whites were not averse to the use of natural remedies, as the following extracts illustrate. “We gave remedies with no success” (Life Sketches, p. 243). “My child grew feeble. We had used simple herbs, but they had no effect” (Life Sketches, p. 253). “I suffered for about one week, nothing seemed to give me relief” (Lt 9, 1853 [Dec. 5]).\nThere are indications that the use of natural remedies was a contentious issue among some Adventists in the 1850s. Speaking of “roots and herbs,” L. V. Masten exclaimed in the Review, “Let such as have no faith use them! I am fully persuaded that God is well pleased to hear prayer for the sick.” On the other hand, D. Hewitt approved of the use of “harmless roots and vegetables” as remedies while warning against the “many kinds of medicine now in use, [which are] deleterious and poison.”\nA vision received by Ellen White in 1853 sanctioned the use of “beneficial” herbs: “I did see that Brother Hart had pressed the abstinence of herbs in case of sickness too far. I saw that it was right to use herbs that are beneficial for the use of men, but the poisonous herbs—tobacco, etc.—it was not right to use, because it was injuring and breaking down the constitution” (Lt 11, 1853 [Dec. 3]).\nSee: John Anthony Caruso, The Great Lakes Frontier, p. 331; James White and Ellen G.

Mary Walker and John Loughborough had married in 1851, both aged about 19. The following year John, already a part-time preacher for the “First-day Adventists,” as he called them, became a Sabbatarian Adventist and started full-time preaching and traveling. The year 1853 must have been particularly trying for Mary. Leaving Mary at home in Rochester, New York, early that year, John embarked on a two-month itinerary with Hiram Edson through western New York and Pennsylvania. He then returned to Rochester for a few weeks before setting off again on a five-month journey through Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin, coming back at the end of September. Ellen White's letter suggests that Mary was not fully prepared for this kind of sacrifice, a theme to which she returns in later letters.\nFor an accessible account of J. N.

The Loughboroughs finally moved west to Iowa in 1856 and the following year to Michigan, but Mary continued to pine for Rochester.

In the February 20, 1855, issue of the Review James White had publicly issued a cry for help, citing overwork, poor health, and lack of financial support as reasons that fundamental changes had to be made. One of the options considered to ease the situation was relocation. During the week prior to the May 5 vision the Whites had consulted with members in Battle Creek, Michigan, about locating the publishing house in their town. James White felt that “the climate, water, prices of rent, fuel, provisions etc. seem favorable to the location,” but he was not ready to make a decision yet. Ellen White's statement that she had “no light” probably refers to this relocation issue. The question was decided only in late August 1855, after James White had investigated the relative advantages of locating in Vermont.\nSee: “The Office,” Review, Feb. 20, 1855, p. 182; James White, “Meetings at Battle Creek,” Review, May 15, 1855, p. 228. For a survey of events leading to the move to Battle Creek, see Gerald Wheeler, James White, pp. 81-83. but was sighted to other visions that God had given.6 An example of an earlier vision dealing with possible relocation of the press was Ms 4, 1854, written in April 1854: “I then saw that the church must be united, and if they could not endure straight testimonies when they were needed and we were bound, we must move the office and go where we could bear them.” Look at them carefully; lose not sight of the opening providences of God; carefully regard all His teachings and obey them. I saw that no longer should those connected with the office bear the burdens they have borne.7 Willing sacrifice had been a central motif for the 15 or so persons working at the publishing house. “Those who … joined us in this enterprise,” James White noted, “toiled for no more than food and clothing. Their deprivations at times, and their toils were not small.” Ellen White provides further insights in an 1853 letter: “Luman is coughing again; his lungs are affected. … He has overdone often. Stephen Belden and Fletcher Byington do not return from the office until 10, 12, 2 or 3 o'clock. They have labored uncommonly hard of late, and God has strengthened them, or they must have broken down.” Luman Masten subsequently died of tuberculosis (1854, age about 25), as did two other colleagues, Anna White (1854, age 26) and Annie Smith (1855, age 27). Conditions of employment did improve after the move to Battle Creek in November 1855. According to the February 21, 1856, edition of the Review, “those who labor in connection with the Review, receive moderate wages.”\nSee: “The Office,” Review, Feb. 20, 1855, p. 182; Ellen G.

Seen in their context, the words “Annie's disappointment” imply unrequited love, and Graybill argues that Annie Smith, possibly through a misunderstanding, thought that Andrews had a serious romantic interest in her, hopes that were subsequently dashed. Graybill endeavors to show that Annie's disappointed hopes left their trace in some of her poems and hymns.\nCertainly J. N. Andrews would have been in frequent contact with Annie Smith during her time at the Review. Throughout this period, in between extended preaching tours, Andrews lived in the vicinity of the Review office, first at Saratoga Springs and then in Rochester. While at Rochester, Andrews boarded for months at a time with the Whites, as did a number of Review staff, including Annie Smith.\nAnnie Smith also fits the description of Lt 1 in the fact of her tragic death from tuberculosis one month earlier, on July 26, 1855, at age 27. The assertion “Annie's disappointment cost her her life” may appear a very severe indictment against J. N. Andrews. Graybill suggests a milder interpretation: “It was probably justified even from a medical standpoint, since depression makes one so much more vulnerable to disease and since there was plenty of disease lurking in that house on Mount Hope Avenue [the White residence in Rochester]. James White's brother Nathaniel and sister Anna had already died of tuberculosis in those crowded quarters.”\nAlthough far less likely, there is a possibility that Ellen White is, in fact, referring to Anna White, sister of James White, rather than to Annie Smith. She calls Anna White “Annie” in at least two places in her writings. Anna White and her brother Nathaniel White came to live with the Whites in Rochester in 1852. Described as “very feeble” when she arrived, Anna became a Sabbathkeeper soon thereafter, her health improved, and by 1854 she had been given the editorship of The Youth's Instructor. However, illness set in again, and she succumbed to tuberculosis in November 1854, at age 25. J. N. Andrews conducted her funeral service.\nSee: Ron Graybill, “The Life and Love of Annie Smith,” Adventist Heritage 2 (Summer 1975): 14-23; “Letters,” Review, Sept. 2, 1851, p. 24; “Conferences,” Review, Mar. 23, 1852, p. 112; J.

Your interest manifested for her was undue and uncalled for, and showed that you had a great lack of confidence in us.5 The criticism in this paragraph and the next, that J. N. Andrews had unwisely sympathized with those who had been admonished and rebuked by the visions, is a recurring theme in subsequent letters from Ellen White to Andrews.\nSee: Ellen G.

The two families had not taken well to the leadership of the Whites during their stay in Paris in 1850-1851, in particular resenting the rebukes received through Ellen White's visions and from James White.

This sounds very much like James and Ellen's journey to New Hampshire and Vermont in January 1851, described by Ellen at some length in her autobiographical account Spiritual Gifts. The notes that follow confirm that this is the case.\nSee: Ellen G. White, Spiritual Gifts [vol. 2], pp. 144-147. when we were there and Brethren Andrews [John Nevins Andrews] and Rhodes [Samuel W.

James was all awake to the interest of the cause and the interest of Brethren Andrews and Rhodes that they should go comfortable, and neglected his own health.7 According to the Spiritual Gifts account and notices in the Review, the Whites lent their horse to Rhodes and Andrews in early January 1851 so that they could travel independently and in relative comfort on their preaching itinerary to Vermont and Canada East. This left the Whites without personal transport for their journey to New Hampshire and Vermont, also in January, and having to arrange transportation on an ad hoc basis as they went along. One of the low points of their trip was the three-day sleigh journey to Waterbury, Vermont. “There were three of us in an open sleigh, without a buffalo skin or even a horse-blanket to protect us from the cold.”\nSee: Ellen G. White, Spiritual Gifts [vol. 2], p. 145. He had been closely confined through the winter, his health and strength run down by lack of nourishing food8 James White later recalled that while boarding with the Andrews family in Paris, during the winter of 1850-1851, “I seldom ate anything beside potatoes and salt with a few spoonfuls of milk on them and corn bread.”\nSee: James White to E. P. Butler, Dec. 12, 1861. and by constant labor. [He] required the greatest care and [needed] to journey comfortably, but he neglected his own health and trusted to get along any way and journeyed most uncomfortably and inconveniently, thinking if he sacrificed for others, God would take care of his health. He disregarded the laws of health, did not study his ease or comfort and was exposed to colds to save expense and help others; and the effects of colds taken upon that journey, and then the trials connected with the journey, have never yet been got rid of.

Although James gained some relief during the spring of 1855, his condition again worsened, and Ellen later confessed that for months prior to their move to Battle Creek in November 1855 she “greatly feared” that her children might be left “without a father's care.”\nSee: Ibid., pp. 194-198; idem, “Communication From Sister White,” Review, Jan. 10, 1856, p. 118. but God has answered prayer in his behalf and done that for him that no medicine could do.

I feel confident that God approves a portion at least of these remedies.”\nSee: James White to Abram A. Dodge, Mar. 11, 1855; L. V. Masten, “Faith,” Review, Oct. 4, 1853, p. 101. said the angel.

While White remained overall manager of the publishing work, Uriah Smith was appointed resident editor, and financial responsibility was vested in a publishing committee rather than being the personal responsibility of James White as before. In addition, with the move to Battle Creek, the Whites no longer had to run a lodging house for Review workers, as they had done in Rochester.

James White later recalled an “Eld. Lothrop” who had joined “in full fury with the Messenger spirits against us and the Review.” Since both “Lothrope” and “Lothrop” are associated with the Messenger Party, it seems likely that they are one and the same person, despite the divergence in spelling. James White provides the further information that Lothrop was a preacher and that the Whites had met him in Canada East. This points to Howard Lothrop, from Eaton, Canada East, as the person in question. There are several reports in the Review of Howard Lothrop's preaching activities during the early 1850s, and James White mentions meeting with “Brother and Sister Lothrop of Eaton” while in Canada East in 1850.\nSee: [James White], “Organization,” Review, Aug. 27, 1861, p. 100; W.

He will move just as soon as he can.15 James White reported a few weeks later in the Review that his parents “desire to see a more fertile soil, and to spend the rest of their days in a milder climate, free from the cares of the old farm home.” They did eventually settle in Battle Creek, Michigan, to be with James and Ellen. The exact date of their move is not known, but according to later reminiscences of James White his father spent his last “twelve years at Battle Creek, Michigan, where he died July 5, 1871,” thus locating the move to about 1859. Certain entries in Ellen White's diary for 1859 support this date (Ms 5, 1859 [Jan. 28 and Mar. 20]). The statement “He will move just as soon as he can” might also, given the context of the letter, refer to John White's intent to keep the Sabbath in the future. There is some disagreement in the sources as to when John and Betsey White actually began to keep the Sabbath. James White, in Life Sketches, claims 1856, but in his father's obituary he gives the year as 1860. The earliest contemporary reference to their observance of the Sabbath is found in Lt 31, 1859 (Feb. 21).\nSee: “Visit to Maine,” Review, Sept. 4, 1855, p. 36; James White, Life Sketches (1880), p. 9; “The Venerable Dead,” Review, July 18, 1871, p. 36; Martha Byington, 1857 diary; Ellen G.

The mention of “the Conference at Sylvan” in the first paragraph is not as useful a clue to the date as may first appear, since Ellen White attended meetings in Sylvan, Michigan, in 1853, 1854, and 1855.

Souls are not prepared for what is coming on the earth, and unless they speedily get ready they will be weighed in the balance and found wanting. I saw that Bro. Cranson [Samuel T. Cranson]3 Identity: From the description given in this passage it is clear that “Bro. Cranson” is a preacher (“messenger”) that likely is based in Michigan. The only person mentioned in the Review during this period who matches this description is Samuel T. Cranson, of Tompkins, Michigan, a lay preacher during the years 1853-1855. Cranson was present at the 1854 Sylvan Conference.\nSee: Search term “Cranson” in Words of the Pioneers; James White, “Western Tour,” Review, May 23, 1854, p. 142. had moved too fast in some cases, that there had not been that patience and forbearance with individuals that there ought to have been. Others of the brethren had moved too fast.4 The discussion that follows, cautioning S. T. Cranson and other leaders against haste in disfellowshipping members, can be seen in the context of the call for “Gospel Order” in the Review from James and Ellen White in 1853-1854. For years Sabbathkeeping Adventists had struggled with the problem of self-appointed preachers propagating beliefs at variance with those of the main body and with members who were far out of line. The problem became more urgent with the rapid growth of membership in the early 1850s and the beginnings of a schismatic movement (the Messenger Party) in 1853. It was to address this pressing issue that James White published his landmark “Gospel Order” series in December 1853, urging greater measures to promote unity. Ellen White, who had addressed the matter on a number of earlier occasions, included a major article entitled “Gospel Order” in her Supplement to the Christian Experience and Views of Ellen G. White, published the following month (January 1854).\nThe problem with Cranson and others was, according to this manuscript, that they were overzealous in implementing gospel order, particularly in the area of disfellowshipping deviant members. James White made the same point in a more general way in June 1854: “The brethren in Michigan” he wrote, “have taken hold of the subject of Gospel Order in good earnest. This is a subject of the greatest importance … but in this matter there must not only be great frankness, and plain dealing with those who do not come up to the gospel rule, but the graces of meekness and patience will be much needed.”\nSee: “Gospel Order,” Review, Dec. 6, 1853, p. 173; Dec. 13, 1853, p. 180; Dec. 20, 1853, pp. 188-190; Dec. 27, 1853, pp. 196, 197; Ellen G.

God had the oversight of the work. I saw that this was an important place.5 Two ways of reading this fragment suggest themselves: (1) that the first two sentences refer to Uriah Smith and the remainder of the section refers to James White, or (2) that the whole fragment deals only with James White.\nIn November 1855 Uriah Smith had taken over the position of chief editor, a post previously occupied by James White. Two months later Ellen White related details of “my last vision” to Smith: “I saw that no station on earth is more important than [the one that] those occupy that are at the head of the paper, and write for it. … God has placed you there. It is an important work” (Lt 8, 1856 [Jan. 21]). The parallels between these sentences and the content and wording of Ms 1, 1855, are interesting and suggest the possibility that Uriah Smith is under discussion. The phrase “if he did not fill his place, God would remove him from it” suggests that Smith at some point had considered giving up his post. Ellen White confirms that this was the case in Lt 6, 1857 (Oct. 8): “I saw that the Lord had called you to occupy the place you are now in, and God has not released you. God has not selected or designed Brother Waggoner for the office to occupy your place. … I saw if you break away from that office, your happiness and peace ends.”\nIt is also possible, perhaps more probable, that the whole passage deals with James White. White had been discouraged to the point of giving up publication of the Review on more than one occasion, but his experience during the winter of 1854-1855 fits the description of this passage particularly well. After his sister Anna White died of tuberculosis, in November 1854, James became seriously sick with symptoms similar to those of Anna. “I have been very fearful,” wrote Ellen White, “that the disease that has preyed upon Nathaniel and Anna is preying upon James. He has been afflicted in the same way and unless he is speedily relieved he will go in the same way.” In his discouragement over ill health and financial problems and the inordinate workload required to keep the publishing work progressing, James announced in the Review in February 1855 that there would have to be “a complete change in many respects … even if we leave the Office entirely.” James White's health did gradually improve over the spring and summer of 1855. It is quite possible that this manuscript fragment dates from this time, noting James's ill health, gradual improvement, and inclination to be released from his publishing responsibilities, but above all appealing to James to rise above these challenges and continue “to stand at the head of the publishing” work. The only discordant note in this interpretation is that in some ways James did stand down from his publishing leadership some months later, in November 1855, when Uriah Smith took over as resident editor and various committees took over financial and managerial tasks, responsibilities previously held by James. Was James then disobedient to the call to continue to “stand at the head of the publishing”? It appears not, because James White, despite some responsibilities devolving on others in 1855, continued to hold overall responsibility for the publishing work even after that.\nSee: Ellen G. White, Lt 8, 1856 (Jan. 21); idem, Lt 6, 1857 (Oct. 8); idem, Lt 5, 1854 (Dec. 16); [James White], “The Office,” Review, Feb. 20, 1855, p. 182. For a survey of administrative changes at the Review in November 1855, see Gerald Wheeler, James White, pp. 86, 87. I saw that it was God who had rebuked the disease that was on James when nature had resisted it as long as it was possible and could do no more, and disease had fastened upon him and when Satan was exulting that he had his prey and that he would lay him in the grave, then God's hand interposed and He put bands around James and strengthened him to fill the place He had put him in."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 466","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Second, an action had been taken at a general conference in November expressing regret for past neglect of the visions of Ellen White and a determination to restore them to their rightful place. Third, and not least significant, with the move to Battle Creek the Whites no longer had to operate a boarding house for the publishing workers, as they had done in Rochester.

Much love to Brother and Sister Cottrell6 Identity: The difficulty in identifying “Brother and Sister Cottrell,” of Mill Grove, New York, is that there were at least three Cottrell families associated with the church in Mill Grove at the time this letter was written: Roswell Fenner and Catherine (née Harvey) Cottrell; John Harvey and Maryette Cottrell; Solomon Gates and Prudence Cottrell. It is unlikely that Solomon and Prudence are referred to in this warm greeting, since Ellen White writes a few years later (Ms 3, 1861 [c. 1861]) that “Solomon's wife was always bitter against the gifts.”\nSee: Search term “Cottrell” in Words of the Pioneers. and their children, Willard7 This person has not been identified. and his wife.

Stephenson,” published in December 1855, include “John H. Cottrell,” whose full name was John Harvey Cottrell. There is evidence that John Harvey was addressed by his middle name, Harvey. There are examples of this usage in the writings of both Ellen White and John Loughborough.

During this time a relationship developed between Uriah Smith and Harriet that eventually led to their marriage two years later. Although Harriet was a person of literary talent, the visions of Ellen White pointed to her lack of spiritual “consecration.” Perhaps in part for this reason Harriet did not continue her employment at the Review for more than a year after the press was moved to Battle Creek, Michigan, in November 1855.

Two significant actions taken at the November conference had a direct and personal bearing on the Whites. First, James White was relieved of sole fiscal and editorial responsibility for the publishing work by the establishment of a publishing committee, and by the appointment of Uriah Smith as resident editor for the Review. Second, action was taken expressing regret for past neglect of the visions of Ellen White and a determination expressed to give them their rightful place in the mission of the church.\nSee: E. G.

Several of his cousins were baptized in 1853 in nearby Clarkson, New York, and it is possible that David also was baptized on that occasion, although the Review account does not include names. When he was about 20 years old (c. 1855) he left New York and moved to Walton Township in Michigan, where he is listed in the 1860 census as “farmer.” This move, it seems, is the occasion for Ellen White's concern for young David Lamson, that he had moved to an area with few, if any, persons of his faith around.\nSee: J. N. Loughborough, The Great Second Advent Movement, pp. 207, 208; idem, “Clarkson Meeting,” Review, Sept. 27, 1853, p. 96; obituary: “David Henry Lamson,” Review, Oct. 26, 1897, p. 687; 1860 U.S. Federal Census, “David H.

The contents are not readily datable except in very general terms. Until recently editors had assigned it the date “circa 1861.” However, an examination of the correspondence from this period reveals a letter by Amanda Westcott that provides a more precise date. Writing on July 16, 1856, she describes a vision given Ellen White during “the conference at Battle Creek” that matches the vision account in Ms 2 very closely, even to the wording. Thus, according to Amanda Westcott, Ellen White saw “that Bro. Arnold and Bro. Hart had been too exacting about the note James published in the Review.” Ellen White's account in Ms 2 reads almost identically: “I saw that Brethren Hart and Arnold had been too exacting about the matter of the note James published in the paper.” This and other parallels seem too close to be coincidental.The vision, wrote Westcott, took place during “the conference at Battle Creek.” The context suggests that the conference had taken place recently. The most recent conference at Battle Creek, Michigan, prior to her letter took place May 23-27, 1856. There are several reasons for concluding that the Ms 2 vision was given at that time. Among these is the fact that David Arnold, whose case is described in Ms 2, writes in the Review of his attendance at the May 1856 “general conference” in Battle Creek where “the Lord … manifested through one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit my condition.” The details given in the Westcott letter and in a later report by Ellen White (Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, p. 127) indicate that the Ms 2 vision was probably given on the last day of the conference, May 27, 1856.\nSee: Amanda Westcott to M. Crawford, July 16, 1856; J. W. [James White], “The Conference,” Review, June 12, 1856, p. 52; David Arnold, “From Bro.

Particularly telling is the statement in the last paragraph that “Brethren Hart and Arnold had been too exacting about the matter of the note James published in the paper.” We know from other sources that both David Arnold and a Brother Hart had taken issue with the Whites on whether the visions should be a test of fellowship. Arnold believed they should be and had reacted negatively to James White's article “A Test” the previous autumn in the Review (Oct. 16, 1855), in which White insisted that “the visions are not a test.” Arnold subsequently debated the issue in a letter to Ellen White and also submitted his viewpoints to James White for publication in the Review. White, however, “declined publishing it,” as Arnold pointed out in a letter to M. Crawford on February 3, 1856. In the same letter David Arnold notes that “Bro. Hart is a strong one on the visions” and had also “labored hard and long last summer” with James White “to convince him that they [the visions] were a test.”\nSee: J. W.

I saw that God had warned those that had moved from the East to the West. He had shown them their duty,—that it must not be their object to get rich; but to do good to souls, to live out their faith and tell to those around them that this world was not their home. The warning was sufficient if it had been heeded; but there was no considering of what God had shown, but rushed on and on, become drunk with the spirit of the world.2 Soon after arriving in Round Grove, in late November 1856, Ellen White noted that “there is quite a settlement of Sabbathkeepers here, from Vermont, New York and Michigan.” With the opening up of new lands in the West, Adventists were part of a national movement westwards. The journey that Ellen and James White undertook in November and December of 1856 to western Illinois and Iowa was especially directed to those believers who had recently moved there from the East. This manuscript, reporting on a vision given while at Round Grove, expresses general disappointment at the spiritual state of the Adventist settlers, and their preoccupation with material pursuits, especially so in view of earlier warnings. In her first “Testimony for the Church,” published one year earlier, Ellen White had written: “I was shown some coming from the East to the West. I saw that it should not be the object of those who leave the East for the West, to get rich, but to win souls to the truth. … If God has called you West, He has a work, an exalted work, for you to do.”\nSee: Ellen G.

Ellen White writes of their struggles with materialism, as does Elon Everts himself in letters to the Review.

According to Ellen White's analysis in her article “A Warning,” Everts had gone west in 1855 “with one intention, his wife with another.” When he was convicted to sell some of his holdings “to advance the cause of God,” his wife and daughter “easily persuaded” him not to go ahead. “Three times she [Elon's wife, Maria] was reproved by vision,” but without relenting. After Maria died in 1856, Elon's daughter, Matilda, continued to “plead” with her father not to sell, and he acceded to her wishes.

Just two months earlier an article entitled “The Seven Churches” by James White in the Review had signaled a major shift in the self-understanding of the emerging Sabbatarian Adventist movement. Prior to that the lukewarm Laodicean church was seen as applying to those Adventists coming out of the 1844 experience who had rejected the third angel's message, often called “nominal Adventists.” In his article of October 16, James White had now boldly identified Sabbatarian Adventists with Laodicea and called them to repentance for their lukewarmness. It was a message that seemed particularly apt in describing the situation of many Adventist settlers in the West.\nSee: J. W.

Parallels can be drawn from Scripture where “by figure God is frequently said to do that which He permits or does not prevent.”\nElaborating on this point in 1883, Ellen White wrote that she “was shown that the judgments of God would not come directly out from the Lord upon them [those refusing His merciful warnings], but in this way: They place themselves beyond His protection. He warns, corrects, reproves, and points out the only path of safety; then if those who have been the objects of His special care will follow their own course independent of the Spirit of God, after repeated warnings, if they choose their own way, then He does not commission His angels to prevent Satan's decided attacks upon them.”\nSee: Ellen G.

Two paragraphs of the letter are devoted to the possibility of “Harriet” joining the Review staff, provided she is personally convinced that this would be God's will for her. Some weeks later, in the spring of 1857, Harriet Stevens moved to Battle Creek, Michigan, and rejoined the Review staff (with whom she had previously worked in 1854-1855).\nConfirming this identity, the first paragraph indicates that “Harriet” wrote her letter from Waukon, Iowa (see notes 3 and 4 below), and it is known from other sources that Harriet Stevens was living in Waukon during this period. The Cyprian Stevens family had moved to Waukon in the spring of 1856. Whether Harriet moved at the same time as the family is unclear, but the evidence is strong that she was there when the Whites visited Waukon in December 1856. In a passage in Spiritual Gifts [vol. 2] Ellen White describes striking charismatic phenomena at an evening meeting at Waukon in December 1856. “The power of God fell upon the company,” she wrote, and “I was prostrated by the power of God. Sister H. N. S. fell from her chair helpless. It seemed to be an awful, yet glorious place. I had no strength for two hours, but seemed to be wrapped in the glory of God.” There can be little doubt that “H. N. S.” refers to Harriet Newall Stevens.\nSee: Obituary, “Harriet N.

Sperry's [Charles W. Sperry]2 Identities: The fact that Hutchins and Sperry are “preaching brethren” (first line) makes it fairly certain that Ellen White is referring to Alfred S. Hutchins and Charles W. Sperry. These two preachers often worked together. Between 1853 and 1861 there are a dozen or so reports of their teaming up to give lecture series in Vermont, Canada, and New York. There is also some evidence that A. S. Hutchins and C. W. Sperry fit the description given in this paragraph of being “worn-out servants” and of “feeble strength.” See note 3 for details.\nSee: Search terms “Hutchins” and “Sperry” in Words of the Pioneers. labor has been to keep the church together. They have taken the burden of the church upon themselves, to dig around it, labor and labor for them until the church would, after the brethren had gotten a little victory, enjoy it, but make scarcely any effort for it themselves. [Then] in a few weeks [they] are sleepy and need the same effort made for them again. They tire and exhaust the strength of the worn-out servants of God.3 When the Whites visited A. S. Hutchins and his wife in Vermont on June 9, 1857, they noted that they looked “pale, care-worn and much wasted in flesh and strength.” The Whites feared that “a lukewarm, worldly church had suffered them to bear burdens grievious to be borne” and that they had been “borne down by laboring in unnecessary trials in the church.” C. W. Sperry also sounded worn out in a letter to the Review editor three months earlier, where he spoke of his “incessant labor and poor health.”\nSee: J. W.

But when, with their own faith and wrestling with God, they obtain the victory, then it is lasting. They know then how much it costs, and they will preserve their consecration. I saw that so much of the efforts of these brethren should not be spent upon a world-loving and sleepy church. I saw that those who have not yet embraced the truth are anxious to hear, and these brethren should go where, at the present time, they can accomplish the most good4 At the end of May or early June 1857, a “Tent Committee” requested that Hutchins and Sperry leave their familiar but less fruitful areas of Vermont and vicinity and “go West,” to new states more open to the Sabbatarian message.

Prior to that the lukewarm Laodicean church had been seen as applying to those Adventists who rejected the Sabbath, often called “nominal Adventists.” In his article of October 16, 1856, James White had instead boldly identified Sabbatarian Adventists with Laodicea and called them to repentance for their lukewarmness. At first this new message had led to repentance and revival but Ellen White later noted that after some months many members had “lost the effect of the message,” hence the reproof and appeal found in this June 1857 manuscript.\nSee: J.

A further reason for determining that “Brother Everts” is Elon Everts is that the Review mentions no other Evertses during this period.\nSee: “Business,” Review, Dec. 4, 1855, p. 80; J. N.

Already by the end of 1855, about the same time the Everts family moved out to Illinois from Vermont, she had issued a general warning and an appeal to the growing numbers of Adventists moving westward. There was a real danger of their becoming engrossed in the material pursuits of buying and developing lands to the neglect of their spiritual mission. Articles sounding the same warning in the Review had followed, reinforced by the Laodicean message which was beginning to be preached in 1856 (see “Laodicean Message” in EGWEnc). Although Everts himself felt convicted to give some of his assets for evangelistic work, his wife and daughter apparently were implacably opposed. Of Everts's wife, Maria, Ellen White reveals that “three times she was reproved by vision” on this issue, but without relenting. After Maria died in November 1856, Everts's daughter, Matilda, continued to oppose her father's plans, and when he himself died two years later “nothing was bestowed upon the cause of God,” with the whole estate passing to the daughter.\nSee: Ellen G.

I saw that there needed to be a thorough reformation all through that section. The professed people of God have disgraced themselves in the eyes of the world by these trials13 The problems of infighting and excessive church trials among members at Roosevelt continued despite Ellen White's appeals in July 1857. Two years later she noted that the same problems continued to “cleave to some like the leprosy” in that church. There seems to have been some improvement, however, at least in the eyes of James White, who reported from a conference held in Roosevelt in 1859 that “the brethren are recovering from their low state. … A rash, hasty, fitful spirit has had a blighting influence in Central New York, but it is being removed under the judicious labors of Brn. Wheeler and Edson.” It appears that the “good judgment” of Hiram Edson, mentioned earlier in this letter to Rhodes, may have played a part by 1859 towards restoring better relationships among the members.\nSee: Ellen G. White, Lt 17, 1859 (Oct. 28); J. W. [James White], “Roosevelt, N. Y., Conference,” Review, Sept. 15, 1859, p. 132. that they never would have had if their hearts had been right in the sight of God.

Chapel's for trial, Bro. Rhodes being chief among them. They staid [sic] there all day talking, but doing little or no good.” This passage, with its focus on trivial church trials, did not mean that there was no place for proper church discipline.

They are so fearful that their brethren will not be zealous and repent [that] they forget that they have wrongs that must be righted,5 The expression “be zealous and repent” is taken from the message to the Laodiceans in Revelation 3:19: “As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.” The implication here is that some members were misusing the Laodicean message to focus on the shortcomings of other members rather than letting it speak to their own faults. Ellen White, writing elsewhere of the situation during this period, says of “the message to the Laodiceans” that “some thought others were not as zealous in repenting as they should be, and instead of taking care of their own souls’ interest, they began … to reprove and bear down upon their brethren.” Since Sabbatarian Adventists had only begun to apply the Laodicean message to their own movement less than a year earlier, it is quite possible that the rash of church trials plaguing the movement as described in Ms 2, 1857 (July 24), was at least partly a result of those who were misusing it.\nSee: Ellen G. White, Lt 17, 1859 (Oct. 28). For surveys of the developing understanding of the “Laodicean message,” see P.

Lt 8, addressed to John Nevins Andrews, mentions the impact of his opinions on Harriet Smith (his sister-in-law) throughout the 1850s. “I saw that you have not taken a decided position in regard to the past, and your position influences Harriet and Uriah much.” It seems very likely, therefore, that the “John” of Lt 6, 1857, is John Nevins Andrews.

Andrews had made an outstanding contribution to the Sabbatarian movement in the early 1850s in terms of his preaching and scholarly writing, his attitude toward the visions and the leadership of James White was ambivalent for many years, until about 1860. Andrews later explained that during this period, while he had no “feelings of enmity” toward the Whites, he “lacked to some extent that living faith in the visions” (1862). Ellen White attributed some of Andrews's problems to the negative influence of his own family and that of the Cyprian Stevens family, all of whom had a long history of skepticism toward the visions and of resentment toward James White's robust leadership style. The fact that both Uriah Smith and J. N. Andrews married into the Cyprian Stevens family led to a situation in which these prominent leaders were to some extent influenced by their respective wives against James White and against the visions. Judging by the tone of Lt 6, Harriet (Stevens) Smith, recently married to Uriah, had not at the time of writing (1857) adopted a strongly critical stance toward the Whites, but this became very evident by 1860, as revealed in the detailed account of Lt 7, 1860.\nSee: J.

Some rejoiced, others wept. … When seated, Mrs. W. began to praise the Lord, and continued rising higher and higher in perfect triumph in the Lord, till her voice changed, and the deep, clear shouts of Glory! Hallelujah! thrilled every heart. She was in vision.” Sylsbre Rumery, it appears, was present on this occasion. The Monterey vision contained specific instruction for several individuals: Sylsbre Rumery (Lt 9, 1857 [Oct.]), Anthony Burwell (Lt 2, 1857 [Oct. 21]), and Uriah and Harriet Smith (Lt 3, Lt 6, 1857 [Oct. 8]).

In that vision I saw the case of Brother Victor Jones [Victor V. Jones]. I saw that the Lord loved him but he had had reasons for discouragement.5 In his report of the Monterey meeting James White mentions a “poor, discouraged brother” who also witnessed Ellen White in vision on October 8. Partly because of “neglect by his wealthy brethren … [he] was returning to strong habits.” Although he does not give his name, the description makes it reasonably certain that James White is speaking of Victor Jones. Ellen White's vision included “a most touching and encouraging message” for Jones, such that he “raised his head… and he and his good wife are again happy in hope.” The 1860 census listed the value of Victor Jones's real estate at a paltry $100 compared to Rumery's $4,000. Apart from his poverty Jones had other “reasons for discouragement,” including a “propensity” for strong drink and a wealthy Adventist neighbor, George T. Lay, who showed too much interest in Jones's wife.\nSee: J. W.

It seems that this is the matter which is being raised again in this October letter.\nSee: Ellen G. White, Lt 1, 1857 (Jan. 28). I saw, Brother Burwell, you should dig down deep; try your motives.

Having just spent a year in Waukon, Iowa, with her husband gone most of the time, Mary had seemed determined to move back to Rochester, even though John's ministerial talents were needed primarily in the Midwest.\nSee: Ellen G.

Elon Everts, to whom this letter is addressed, a farmer and traveling minister, had migrated to Round Grove from Vermont in 1855. Some months earlier, in July 1857, Ellen White had admonished Everts, “you must be narrowing down your large farms. … Cut loose, cut loose from your treasures here; lay up a treasure in heaven.” The testimonies to Everts and the Round Grove members were part of a larger appeal to the increasing numbers of Sabbatarian Adventists who were migrating from the Eastern states to the Midwest in the mid-1850s. As early as 1855 Ellen White had appealed to those moving westward not to become engrossed in the material pursuits of buying and developing lands to the neglect of their spiritual mission.\nSee: Ellen G.

Why the group at Round Grove, in particular, had “misjudged and wronged” George Butler is not clear. In 1855, while still an unbeliever, George Butler had visited Round Grove with the apparent intention of courting Lentha Lockwood, one of the band.

The clearest indication that it cannot have been written before 1856 is found toward the end of the letter, where Sabbatarian Adventists are identified with the Laodicean church of Revelation 3:14-21. An article by James White entitled “The Seven Churches” in October 1856 had signaled a major theological shift. Prior to that the lukewarm Laodicean church of Revelation was seen as symbolizing those Adventist bodies that rejected the Sabbath, but in his article James White boldly identified Sabbatarian Adventists with Laodicea and called on them to repent for their lukewarmness. For this reason this letter can hardly be dated earlier than October 1856. Neither can it have been written later than February 22, 1859, the death date of Amanda Phillips, who appears to be the “Sister Phillips” addressed several times in the letter.\nThe more specific suggestion “circa 1857” as the date for this letter builds on the comment in the second-to-last paragraph that Stephen Pierce had not contributed enough to the Review, of which he was a corresponding editor. “You have been silent too much. … In the paper you could speak to hundreds. … Your talent, Bro. P., has been almost buried up.” It seems likely that the sparseness of his articles were the occasion for James White's publicly expressed consternation in December 1856: “Some of our Corresponding Editors have well done; but where are Brn.

Both their gifts are needed where they have not yet been, where their gifts are new and can affect more.4 Up to the mid-1850s both Stephen Pierce and Daniel Phillips had tended to restrict their preaching to their home state of Vermont with occasional forays a little further afield. As concerns Phillips, his participation in tent meetings in Michigan and Illinois during the autumn and winter of 1857 may be attributed to Ellen White's challenge in this letter for him to enter new fields. (Whether this was the case depends on the exact date of the letter.) Viewing the paths subsequently taken by Stephen Pierce and Daniel Phillips after being challenged in this letter to greater efforts, it is clear that Pierce's response was the more positive of the two. He served in the 1860s as president of the Vermont and Minnesota conferences. Phillips, after some effective ministry in the 1850s, became involved in several compromising situations that lessened his usefulness, as evidenced in letters to him from Ellen White in the early 1860s.\nSee: A.

God directed them to go, but not to do as they have done. After they were West, they should have lived out their faith; but they have acted like drunken men.8 In the mid-1850s a considerable number of believers from New England migrated to what is now called the “Midwest.” This resulted, at least temporarily, in dwindling numbers in some New England congregations, and in some cases resentment from those left behind. As one man expressed it: “When the Lord called those dear brethren from Vt., to the West, many were sorely afflicted like myself, and felt as though we were left desolate and forsaken.” Review editorials, on the other hand, saw the westward movement much more positively, as an opportunity for rapid evangelical growth: “We would say that those in the East, who have toiled year after year to pull a very few souls out of the fire, that the same efforts in the West, or even here in Michigan, would convert twenty to the truth, where you have seen one conversion. … No consideration whatever, excepting a sense of positive duty, could induce us at present to labor on the gospel-hardened shores of New England, while so much can be done in the wide West.” Meanwhile it was also recognized that some Adventist settlers had moved west mainly out of an expectation of economic gain, and were experiencing spiritual decline.\nSee: E.

Discouragement had led John Loughborough off course from his earlier wholehearted devotion to evangelism. Despite considerable talent as a preacher, by December 1856 Loughborough was low in funds and fully engaged in carpentry, in order to make a living. The visit of the Whites to Waukon in that same month was a decisive turning point for him. “It was on this occasion that I laid up my carpenter tools for good,” he writes, and returned to full-time evangelism. The Whites, recognizing Loughbough's strengths and the leading role he could play in the movement, were anxious to settle him and his wife in Battle Creek, the headquarters of the movement. James White had raised funds to buy them a house, and Ellen had solicited bedding and other household essentials for them from friends.

It was God's will that you should not go to Rochester last fall; it would have proved your ruin. John would have been driven from the field to laboring with his hands. God would not have it so. He laid out the work for John, to save you both. I saw that you can never have the light of God's countenance until you acknowledge the hand of God in all this. He has wrought for you, but you have shut your eyes to His work. If you humbly submit to God, then will it please God to have you visit Rochester, for you can glorify God. I saw that John must fix his eye upon his captain, Jesus, follow the counsel of God, whether it meets your will or not. He must be steadfast. His course must be fixed, but with the greatest tenderness and care should he deal with Mary, never wounding with words, but yet be decided."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 561.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Since moving to Battle Creek in November 1857, John Loughborough had gone out to preach with James White on a number of weekends in towns such as Monterey, Otsego, Jackson, and Hillsdale, all within a 50-mile (80-kilometer) radius of Battle Creek. They also had plans to conduct a series of conferences in New York State during the spring (which never materialized, because of lack of funds).\nSee: J. N. Loughborough, James White, “Appointments,” Review, Nov. 19, 1857, p. 16; idem, “Appointments,” Dec. 17, 1857, p. 48; “Appointments,” Review, Jan. 28, 1858, p. 96; J. N.

I was pointed to the life of John the Baptist.15 In Spiritual Gifts [vol. 1], pp. 29, 30, Ellen White reused the next few lines in writing on the life of John the Baptist. Her description of John's “sorrowful” life has been contrasted by some with later statements that speak of the joy he experienced in his life mission. Such statements should be viewed as complementary. Although John's life was without the pleasures associated with the “enjoyments and luxuries of life,” and he was denied the privilege of sharing in Christ's miraculous ministry, Ellen White recognized that true joy is not constrained by one's circumstances. She brought both perspectives together when she wrote, “Aside from the joy that John found in his mission, his life had been one of sorrow” (The Desire of Ages, pp. 101, 220). His life was without pleasure. It was sorrowful and self-denying. He proclaimed Christ's advent and then could not see and enjoy the power manifested by Christ. He knew that when Jesus should fully establish Himself as a Teacher he must die. He was cruelly beheaded. I saw that the least disciple that followed Jesus, witnessed His miracles, heard the comforting words that fell from His lips, was greater than John the Baptist; that is, more exalted and honored, had more pleasure in his life."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 562.2","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

I saw that the holy angels had one after another left you, grieved, displeased, and disgusted with your wrangling and strife.9 The problem of “wrangling and strife” among members in Oswego County, was not a new one. The Roosevelt church in particular seems to have been implicated. In July 1856 Amanda Westcott wrote of internal dissension in Roosevelt, a full-day church “trial,” and the division of the church into two factions. Union seems to have been restored only after intervention from “Bro. Sperry of Vt.” One year later conditions appear to have deteriorated. Ellen White writes of faultfinding (with special mention of Finch and Chapel) and numerous church trials in Roosevelt through which “the professed people of God have disgraced themselves in the eyes of the world” (Lt 8, 1857 [July 19]). Ironically, the “Laodicean” call to the churches “be zealous … and repent” (Rev. 3:19) that had gone out in the late autumn of 1856 seems in certain cases to have led to an increase in dissension and church trials. The problem was that some members had interpreted the Laodicean message as a call to watch for faults among fellow members rather than to repent of their own shortcomings.\nSee: Amanda Westcott to Mrs. Crawford, July 16, 1856; Ellen G. White, Lt 8, 1857 (July 19); Lt 17, 1859 (Oct. 28); EGWEnc, s.v. “Laodicean Message.” There is the vision I wrote after the meeting.

Rhodes, who had worked extensively among the Oswego churches. “Many have depended on you to have an experience for them,” Ellen White wrote to Rhodes in 1859, “because you have told them what they must do, and what they must not do. … You have … descended to little particulars, and entered into family matters that in no way concerned you.”\nSee: Ellen G.

Day [John C. Day], while among the Messenger advocates,3 John C. Day had joined the Sabbatarian Adventists in 1851 but defected to the breakaway Messenger Party in 1854 or 1855. By October 1856, however, he had returned to the Sabbatarian Adventists and written a contrite letter to the Review asking “forgiveness … of the entire church.”\nSee: John C. Day, “Letter From Bro. Day,” Review, Oct. 9, 1856, p. 184. was cruel, crooked, and wicked; that people were composed of dissatisfied ones who would not bear reproof,4 The best known examples of persons who “would not bear reproof” were Hiram Case and Charles P. Russell, founders of the Messenger Party. J. C. Day may also have held a grudge against the visions, dating back to 1852. In 1852 J. C. Day had been actively discouraged by the Whites from continuing his traveling ministry which he had apparently engaged in since accepting the Sabbath in 1851. In vision Ellen White “saw that he [Day] has been mistaken and thought God had a greater work for him to do than He had ever laid upon him.” It is possible that Day was offended by this vision and that this was one reason for his subsequent defection.\nWhile it is true that anti-White, anti-vision sentiments were prominent in the Messenger Party, these did not constitute its entire platform. Other significant theological differences also emerged. Thus the “Age-to-Come” view of the judgment and millennium, which differed fundamentally from the eschatology of Sabbatarian Adventists, became an important plank of the Messenger Party after the accession of J. M. Stephenson and D. P. Hall in 1855 or 1856.\nSee: EGWEnc, s.v. “Messenger Party”; SDAE, s.v. “Messenger Party”; John C. Day, “Letter From Bro. Day,” Review, Oct. 9, 1856, p. 184; Ellen G.

These unruly spirits came together and united together to work or fight against those whom God had raised up to stand in defense of His truth. Satan and his angels were at war with them, fighting against them, and these people were co-workers with Satan and the evil angels. Falsehoods and lies would be formed by Satan's children, and this people loved them and eagerly reported them to others. J. C.

James White noted that Ellen White had received a vision during these meetings. “The Spirit of the Lord came down upon us on Sabbath afternoon, and the Lord there pled with his people, as it were, face to face.” It is also of interest to note that J.

Haskell later provided many years of distinguished leadership to the church, the comments made here indicate that the early years after his adoption of the Sabbath in 1853 or 1854 were problematic. The matter of the Haskells’ advocacy of “mortifying the flesh” seems at least in part to be related to denying themselves “wholesome food” (see two paragraphs on) as a religious duty. No further details are given here but Ellen White elaborates on this theme in a letter to “Brother and Sister A” published in 1859 (Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, pp. 204-209). Some have argued that “Brother and Sister A” are in fact the Haskells.\nSee: EGWEnc, s.v. “Stephen N. Haskell.” are all erroneous and will lead to deadly evils and the destruction of souls, and instead of increasing moral purity will hasten and strengthen moral pollution. Said the angel, “God reads the heart.” I saw that S. Haskell has tried to make it appear that he was in union with the church when it was not the case. He has scattered evil, error, and division every place he has entered, and this has been in a sly undercurrent that has been at work to destroy confidence in the visions and in those who have the charge of the work at Battle Creek.10 Some years later S. N. Haskell in a published statement confessed that “after I first embraced the present truth, and heard of Bro. and Sr. White … my mind became very much prejudiced against them, especially against Bro. White. … I was prepared to look upon every move of his with suspicion and jealousy.” Haskell attributed his negativity to the Whites to the fact that he had become “acquainted with those who were their enemies.” Included among these acquaintances was probably J. C. Day, described earlier. J. C. Day and S. N. Haskell would have had ample opportunity to meet as they both lived in Worcester County, Massachusetts, during the latter 1850s.\nConcerning Haskell's lack of union with the Battle Creek leadership, he later recalled how, in the late 1850s, “I preached, organized churches and Sabbath Schools, ordained elders … but I was not even licensed. Did not know it was necessary to have a license to preach.” Haskell's reconciliation with the Whites and Battle Creek can be traced in the letters he sent to the Review between November 1859 and June 1863, that, though worded generally, seem to reflect his own situation. In 1862, for the first time, he writes positively of the value of “the gift of prophecy, in correcting wrongs,” and in 1863 he speaks of “the folly of steering through these last-day perils on an independent train,” adding that “many of us here in the East have much to learn.”\nSee: John Nevins Andrews et al., Defense of Elder James White and Wife, p. 33; S.

I saw that instead of this Sister Mary should stand in a place to hold up the hands of her husband, and by cheerful looks, words, and actions cheer his spirits; she should be ready to pray with and for him, and then with him she will share the reward."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 577.3","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

According to further information published in The Good Samaritan, she lived “about ten miles [16 kilometers] from Battle Creek.” All this points to Catherine Irving, listed in the 1860 census as living in Ross township, Michigan, a few miles from Battle Creek. According to the census, there was an Agnes, age 18, in the household, but no male adult. The name of Catherine's dying husband can be found in a Review obituary, which reported that William Irving, “of Ross, Mich.,” died on June 4, 1859, “of consumption.”\nSee: E. G. W. [Ellen G.

Also recorded are two or three lengthy visits they made to their son John B. Harmon, who lived in Illinois. It appears that the Harmons were staying with their son in Illinois when Eunice Harmon died in 1864.\nSee: Ellen G.

Orton, of Rochester, New York, who had two children by that name. (For identities of other addressees listed in the entries of January 3 and January 4, see note 15.)\nSee: 1850 U.S. Federal Census, “Jonathan Orton,” “Drusilla Orton,” “Alva Orton,” New York, Monroe County, Rochester, Ward 7, p. 317. family; also wrote four pages to Brother Howland's [Stockbridge Howland] family, and wrote to Sister Ashley [Melora A.

Some of these make it quite clear that the Benedicts lived in Battle Creek. Fortunately, the 1860 census has only one Benedict household in Battle Creek, that of Joseph (age 55), Milly (age 50), Diantha (age 26), Betsy (age 15), and Benjamin (age 53). That these are the Sabbatarian Benedicts Ellen White is addressing is confirmed by J. N. Loughborough, who makes mention of a “Sr. Diantha Benedict,” apparently living in the Battle Creek area, in his diary for 1859 (the title “Sr.” indicating her Sabbatarian faith). This letter is not in the White Estate archives.\nSee: 1860 U.S. Federal Census, “Joseph Benedict,” Michigan, Calhoun, Battle Creek, p. 53; J. N.

Jenny and Mother spent the afternoon with Sister Smith.19 Two unrelated families with the name Smith are known to belong to the Battle Creek group at this time—Harriet and Uriah Smith and Louisa and Cyrenius Smith. It is uncertain whether Harriet or Louisa is referred to here, but it is more likely Harriet, who assisted at the Review office.\nSee: Search terms “Smith” and “Battle Creek” in Words of the Pioneers. While [I was] folding, Sister Cornell [Cornelia A. Cornell]20 Identity: Three Cornell brothers, Merritt E., Myron J., and James, with their families, were members of the Battle Creek Adventist community at various times from the 1850s and onward. However, at the time of writing, i.e., January 1859, two of these families were not living in Battle Creek. Merritt E. spent the winter of 1858-1859 preaching in Ohio. It is known from several sources that his wife, Angeline, usually accompanied Merritt on his preaching tours. They had no children. James Cornell, a shoemaker, although listed in the 1860 census as living in Battle Creek, was apparently working in Monterey, Michigan, at this time, because Ellen White notes in her diary that on Jan. 16, 1859, eleven days later, she “took dinner at Brother James Cornell's” in Monterey. Ellen White is most probably referring to Cornelia, wife of Myron Cornell, in this diary entry.\nSee: J. W. [James White], [notice re. M. E. Cornell], Review, Sept. 30, 1858, p. 152; Ellen G. White, Lt 10, 1863 (Nov. 28); Ms 5, 1859 (Jan. 16 entry); obituary: “Angeline M. A.

For lists of early Battle Creek church members, see EGWEnc, s.v. “Battle Creek Tabernacle.” came in and wished me to go down street to get some things for Roxanna.21 Identity: This might be Roxanna Cornell, wife of James Cornell and sister-in-law to Cornelia Cornell. It is possible that Cornelia, knowing Ellen White planned to visit Monterey within the next week or so, requested Ellen to take “some things” to her sister-in-law. Walked down, got the things, returned to Brother Smith's for supper, then home with Jenny, Mother, James, Edson, and Willie.

The desperate situation of the Irvings seems also, in part, to have caused James White to launch The Good Samaritan paper later that year. The second issue, published in December 1859, contained among other items an appeal by Ellen White on behalf of the Irvings. In the following issue, February 1860, several sums of money were receipted “for Sister I. of No. 2,” and a report was given of funds that had been dispersed to “Sr. Widow Irving.”\nSee: “Receipts,” The Good Samaritan, February 1860, p. 12; Harriet N.

Many of those who were Cranmer's [Gilbert Cranmer]28 Identity: The fact that “Cranmer” is connected in this passage with “division” among the believers and that his followers are found in Otsego suffice to identify him as Gilbert Cranmer, who had separated from the Sabbatarian Adventists in 1858, the beginnings of what later became the Church of God (7th Day). A conference held in Battle Creek in May 1858 had warned that “G. Cranmer has been preaching views contrary to the present truth,” and a letter, some months later, from Otsego church members reported that Cranmer had “drawn off with him eight of the [Otsego] church … all of the men being tobacco eaters.”\nSee: Joseph Bates, Uriah Smith, “Business Proceedings of the Conference of May 21st, 1858,” Review, May 27, 1858, p. 13; George Leighton, Rocksilda Leighton, “Testimony,” Review, Sept. 9, 1858, p. 132.

Branch (n.d.); Richard C. Nickels, A History of the Seventh Day Church of God, passim; SDAE, s.v. “Marion Party.” followers were present.29 J. N. Loughborough notes in his diary that he “spoke to about 30, some of them Cranmerites.”\nSee: J. N. Loughborough, “Diary,” entry for Jan. 8, 1859. They wished to know why there should be a division. They said the house of God was not divided; that as God was with us so He was with them, that Cranmer preached the same as Brother Loughborough preached.30 Gilbert Cranmer taught the seventh-day Sabbath and the Second Advent and in that sense “preached the same as Brother Loughborough preached.” There were differences, however. The following year, in conversation with Joseph Bates, Cranmer asserted that “we … believe and teach the same as the Battle Creek church, except the visions of Mrs. White, and a part of the midnight cry, and some of the work in the Sanctuary.” According to Cranmer's later memoirs his antipathy to the visions was a leading factor in his secession. “I made up my mind I would not belong to a church that was ruled by a woman any longer.” J. N. Loughborough maintained that it was Cranmer's unwillingness to give up tobacco and reform his domestic life, as called for in Ellen White's vision one year earlier, that caused him to break away.\nSee: Joseph Bates, “Letter From Bro. Bates,” Review, Jan 26, 1860, p. 76; Richard C. Nickels, A History of the Seventh Day Church of God, pp. 36, 37; J. N.

However, the similar-sounding name “Hadden” is found in all three sources, so it is likely that this is simply a spelling error by Ellen White. As to the identities of “Brother Hatten” and his brother and wife, some help can be found in the register of Otsego church members of 1861. This lists “Lewis Hadden” with some of his family, and also “Hettie M. Hadden,” who was married to George Hadden. No proof that Lewis and George Hadden were brothers has been found, but it seems likely, since both came to Michigan from Putnam County, New York, and both married daughters of Jeremiah Travis, of Putnam County. That “Brother Hatten” is Lewis and his brother and wife are George and Hettie, who are interested but not yet members, is inferred from the fact that there is no mention of Hettie in the Review before 1860, whereas Lewis (“L. Hadden”) is found already in 1857. George, it appears, never joined the Adventists.\nSee: “Book of Records of the Seventh-day Advent Church in Otsego”; William Richard Cutter, Genealogical and Family History of Southern New York and the Hudson River Valley, vol. 3, p. 889; search term “Hadden” in Words of the Pioneers. were present.

During his stay in Battle Creek, Andrews was co-opted to participate in an important meeting on “Systematic Benevolence” on January 16, and together with J. B.

The very slightest of the jolts with which the ponderous carriage fell from log to log was enough, it seemed, to have dislocated all the bones in the human body.”\nPlank roads, on the other hand, gave a much smoother ride, and were popular in mid-nineteenth-century America.

We rode 14 miles [22 kilometers] to Brother Hardy's [William J. Hardy].65 Identity: Although there are several Hardys mentioned in the Review during this period, the one referred to here is almost certainly William J. Hardy. According to the diary kept by J. N. Loughborough on this trip, “Bro. Hardy” lived in or near the township of Caledonia, Kent County. In a letter to the Review in 1858, William J. Hardy tells of worshipping with “the Sabbath-keepers in Caledonia,” although he apparently lived in the adjoining township of Gaines. Additional confirmation is provided by Ellen White's observation that the Hardys were “a colored family.” The 1860 census lists “Wm. J. Hardy” as “mulatto.”\nSee: J. N. Loughborough, “Diary,” entry for Jan. 25; Wm. J. Hardy, “From Bro. Hardy,” Review, Apr. 29, 1858, p. 191; 1860 U.S. Federal Census, “Wm. J. Hardy,” Michigan, Kent County, Gaines, p. 94. Brother Cramer did not give us the right directions, and we went four miles [six kilometers] out of our way. Did not arrive at Brother Hardy's until dinner time. It was snowing fast. We were heartily welcomed by the family. A good dinner was soon in readiness for us, of which we thankfully partook. This is a colored family. Although the house is poor and old, everything is arranged with neatness and exact order. The children are well behaved, intelligent, and interesting. May I yet have a better acquaintance with this dear family. The meeting is four miles [six kilometers] beyond Brother Hardy's. They accompanied us to the meeting. It was held in a private house.

Loughborough informs us in his diary entry for Jan. 25 that the traveling party came to Caledonia on that day. The problem is that there is no mention in census records nor in the Review of any “Brother Gerald” living in Caledonia township during this period. Loughborough says that they stayed with “Br. Geruld.” Three months later, on passing through Caledonia again, Ellen White wrote in her diary of staying the night at “Brother Gerould's.” She may be using alternate spellings for the same person. There is some evidence of this ambivalence found when comparing Lt 12, 1861 (Dec.), with Ms 3, 1863 (July 22). In both cases she addresses various persons in the Caledonia church, including a “Brother Gerould” in Lt 12 and a “Brother Gerald” in Ms 3. Yet the counsel given to both of them is so similar that there seems little doubt she is addressing the same person. The spelling “Gerould” is preferred in this study since that is the use consistently adopted in the Review.\nSee: J. N. Loughborough, “Diary,” entry for Jan. 25; Ellen G.

I needed one about this time, about as much as any garment.” Events mentioned in the letter indicate that it was written in February 1859, even though earlier editors have dated it “cir. 1852.” The generosity of the Monterey members did not stop here.

Questions remaining unanswered include whether “Jane Seaman” was, in fact, the “Sarah Jane Seaman,” of whom more is known; whether she was the wife of “E. R.

The Review published numerous letters from John and/or Catherine Byington signed “Ceresco, Michigan.” They had moved from New York to Ceresco (actually to the adjacent township of Newton; Ceresco was probably the postal address) in 1858.

The 1860 census lists only two Godsmark households in all of Michigan, that headed by John Godsmark and that headed by his brother Richard Godsmark, both living in Bedford Township, a few miles north of Battle Creek. There is no mention of John Godsmark or any of his household in the Review or other current Adventist sources, whereas these contain many mentions of “R. Godsmark,” “Richard Godsmark,” and “Sr. H.

Persuasive evidence that Marguerite is the “Sister Ratel(le)” Ellen White writes of is found in a newspaper interview given by Marguerite Ratelle on her ninetieth birthday in which she tells of moving to Battle Creek about 1854 and how “she knew Elder James White … and Mrs. Ellen G. White, the prophetess, well, they living neighbor to her.” The article adds that “their friendship was a pleasant one despite their religious differences, Mrs. Ratelle being a Baptist.”\nSee: 1860 U.S. Federal Census, “Margret Rotell [sic],” Michigan, Calhoun County, Emmett, p. 152; 1870 U.S. Federal Census, “Margaret Ritell [sic],” Michigan, Barry County, Johnstown, p. 194; 1880 U.S. Federal Census, “Margret Rattell [sic],” Michigan, Calhoun County, Battle Creek, p. 50; 1900 U.S. Federal Census, “Margaret Ratelle,” Michigan, Calhoun County, Battle Creek Ward 3, p. 165; “In Battle Creek Over 63 Years: Mrs. Marguerite Ratelle, Who is 90, Recalls Early Day Experiences,” newspaper account, Oct. 2, 1919, in Ross Coller Collection, Willard Library, Battle Creek, Michigan; “Mrs. Chapman, B.

Nichols considered it medicinal … ‘far better and much safer for a tonic, or other medicinal uses, than the wines generally sold as Port Wines, etc. for such purposes. It is peculiarly adapted to some diseases and states of the system, and is particularly recommended for derangements of the liver.’”\nIt should be noted that of the five mentions in her 1859 diary of Ellen White taking wine or giving it to others, in four cases the context makes it clear that it was for medicinal use (Ms 5, 1859 [Mar. 3, 10], Ms 6, 1859 [Apr. 15, May 7]). When Ellen White on April 13 simply stated that she “sent her [Sister Fults] a bottle of wine,” it can be safely assumed that this was also for a medicinal purpose.\nSee: Andrew F.

No doubt his research was done at the Rochester Theological Seminary library, which at this time had a collection of some 7,000 volumes, much of it in the area of church history.

This is one of several references showing that Martha Byington worked in the White home, at least sporadically, prior to her marriage to George W. Amadon in 1860. The earliest of these is a notation in her diary dated Sept. 4, 1857: “Arrived at Bro. White's in BC,” followed by “Began teaching White boys,” dated Nov. 12, 1857.\nSee: Obituary: “Martha D.

We were perplexed; took it all to pieces and made it over. Spent the afternoon with [Mary] Loughborough; attended meeting in the eve. Had quite a free, interesting meeting. After it was time to close, the subject of voting was considered and dwelt upon. James first talked, then Brother Andrews talked, and it was thought by them best to give their influence in favor of right and against wrong. They think it right to vote in favor of temperance men being in office in our city, instead of—by their silence—running the risk of having men of non-temperance put in office. Brother Hewitt [David Hewitt]114 The identity of “Brother Hewitt” is not at first obvious, since a number of Sabbatarians with that surname lived in various places during this period. The same holds for the names Hart, Lyon, and Kellogg, mentioned in the following lines. However, the likelihood is that most of the men listed lived in Battle Creek or vicinity. This conclusion is based on the fact that the “meeting” that they attended was not advertised or reported in the Review, which no doubt it would have been if it had been held with representation from a wider area. If, then, the field is narrowed to the Battle Creek area, most likely the men referred to are David Hewitt, Henry Lyon, and John Preston Kellogg. No “Brother Hart” can be found living in the Battle Creek area during this time, so it remains uncertain whether the visitor was Asa Hart, of Ingham County, Michigan; A. G. Hart, from Iowa; P. Hart, from Connecticut; or some other Hart.\nSee: Search terms “Hewitt,” “Hart,” “Lyon,” and “Kellogg,” in Words of the Pioneers; EGWEnc, s.v. “Battle Creek Congregation.” told his experience of a few days, and is settled that it is right to cast his vote. Brother Hart talked well. Brother Lyon [Henry Lyon] opposed. No other objected to voting, but Brother Kellogg [John Preston Kellogg] begins to feel that it is right. Pleasant feelings exist among all the brethren. Oh, that they may all act in the fear of God. Men of intemperance have been in the office today, in a flattering manner expressing their approbation of the course of Sabbathkeepers in not voting, and expressing hope that they will stick to their course and, like the Quakers, not cast their vote. Satan and his evil angels are busy at this time and he has a work upon the earth. May Satan be disappointed, is my prayer.115 This report showing that leading Sabbatarian Adventists, including Ellen White, favored participation in the 1859 Battle Creek local election, is noteworthy. Although having strong views on moral issues such as slavery and temperance, most Adventists had until now rejected the path of political activism to achieve changes in society. “We declare our neutrality in politics,” Uriah Smith had asserted before the 1856 presidential election, “and refuse to take part in a contest so exciting as the one which is now agitating this nation.” The transition from such an apolitical stance to a more activist, albeit a selective and cautious activist, stance in the years that followed is traced in the studies by Syme, Gordon, Butler, and Morgan listed below. They also offer differing perspectives on the influence of premillenialism, views on the role of America in prophecy, and other factors in shaping Seventh-day Adventist perspectives on political involvement.\nSee: “Politics,” Review, Sept. 11, 1856, p. 152; Eric Douglas Syme, A History of SDA Church-State Relations in the United States; Paul A.

To accommodate such traditionalist thinking, retail prices and wages were often expressed in shillings and pence well into the nineteenth century although actual payment would be made in American currency (or with certain foreign coins that remained legal tender until 1857). The “exchange rate” applied to such transactions in Michigan, New York, and Ohio was set at eight shillings to the dollar, or 12.5 cents to the shilling. (Rather confusingly for the traveler, different exchange rates were employed in other states.) Thus when Ellen White wrote here of giving “nine shillings” and on March 10 of paying “nine shillings a week” in wages, this would translate into one dollar and 12.5 cents.\nSee: Robert E. Wright, Hamilton Unbound: Finance and the Creation of the American Republic, p. 99; Daniel Adams, Arithmetic, p. 221. and a stout pair of calfskin shoes.

A few months earlier James White had appealed for contributions to the impoverished Czechowski family and specifically commended “Brn.

When referring to her own parents, the Harmons, Ellen most often (though not always) used the form “my father,” etc. In this case there is clear evidence that Ellen is writing of John and Betsey White because of references in this entry and in the March 21 and March 24 entries to “Father and Mother” relocating. Property records confirm that James and Ellen White sold property to John White on March 22, 1859.\nSee: Deed, Calhoun County, Michigan, liber 46, p. 164, Mar. 22, 1859, recorded June 29, 1859.

It is probable that the move mentioned in this diary entry relates to the Meads’ transfer to Iowa. The earliest mention of the Meads in Iowa is found in an entry in Ellen White's diary, Oct. 21, 1859 (Ms 8, 1859). For James White's fund-raising on behalf of Thomas Mead, see J. W.

According to the census John Farnsworth was born in New Hampshire and was 26 years old. This raises the probability that “John Farnsworth” is, in fact, John P. Farnsworth, son of William Farnsworth, of Washington, New Hampshire, sometimes loosely considered “the first Seventh-day Adventist.” The only problem is the stated age, “26.” John P. Farnsworth was, in fact, 25 years old when the census was taken in June 1860. This discrepancy, however, is not serious, given the anomalies often found in census records.\nSee: 1860 U.S. Federal Census, “John Farnsworth,” Michigan, Calhoun County, Battle Creek, p. 27; SDAE, s.v. “William Farnsworth”; obituary: “John P.

As we journeyed along we met a smooth, clever-looking dog; as he trotted along, we noticed a large, fierce, savage-looking dog standing by the roadside looking very fierce, waiting the coming of the clever-looking animal, ready to pounce upon him. We thought we would watch the result. Soon the little dog that was trotting along noticed his fierce companion and slacked his pace. He seemed to understand the nature of his enemy and he dared not run by, but in a most humble manner crawled along upon the ground. Thus he continued to crouch and crawl until he had come up to the fierce-looking dog, who immediately pounced upon him. The dog would not battle but rolled upon the ground in a begging manner. The big dog could not fight alone. He left the clever, pleading animal, who was still afraid of irritating him. So he walked along slowly, acting as though he wished to run but did not dare to. At length he increased his pace a little until he was sure he could outrun the other big dog; then he ran along as fast as he could go, looking back to see if the other followed.

William Smith's younger son, Stephen, also seems to have seriously considered joining the movement. “I saw that angels of God were seeking to attract … [Stephen] to the truth,” Ellen White wrote in 1865. “He was turning partly away saying, ‘Not yet.

Loughborough's diary account, also from 1859, in which he visits a “Bro. Hyde” while in Ceresco. It is likely that Loughborough is referring to the same family and that he has the correct spelling. One possibility is that Ellen White is referring to Margaret S. and John Hyde, of the adjacent township of Newton, where John Byington and Charles Glover, also mentioned in this entry, lived. The obituary for Margaret Hyde in 1891 establishes that she and her husband had lived in Newton Township since the 1840s, and implies that their connection with Sabbathkeeping Adventists went back to the very early period. The name “Margaret Hyde” appears among Review receipts in 1862 but without giving her address.\nSee: J. N. Loughborough, “Diary,” entries for Jan. 27, 29, Feb. 13; search terms “Hide” and “Hyde” in Words of the Pioneers; obituary, “Margaret S. Hyde,” Review, Jan. 6, 1891, p. 15. family.

Glover was one of the neighbors of John Byington, leaving little doubt about the identity of the “Brother Glover” and his family.\nSee: 1860 U.S. Federal Census, “Charles Glover,” “John Byington,” Michigan, Calhoun County, Newton, p. 244.

Sabbath afternoon engaged in prayer for Martha [Martha Dormer Amadon (née Byington)]25 Identity: Of the three families mentioned in this entry, the only family member named “Martha” in the 1860 census is 25-year-old Martha Byington. This identity is confirmed by the reference in this entry to Martha's serious illness and the prayers that were offered on her behalf. Two months later, on June 21, Ellen White wrote to John Byington and reminded him that “God had been very merciful to you. God has heard the earnest prayers put up in Martha's behalf, and spared her life when she was marked for the grave.”\nSee: 1860 U.S. Federal Census, “John Hyde,” Michigan, Calhoun County, Newton, p. 237; “Charles Glover,” “John Byington,” p. 244; Ellen G. White, Lt 2, 1859 (June 21). whom we found much reduced with fever and ague [chills]. The Lord truly met with us. Martha was blessed and strengthened. James was powerfully moved upon by the Spirit of the Lord. Brother Byington appeared cold and unfeeling. His heart is too much wrapped up in the things of this world.26 Other sources provide some explanation for Byington's “cold and unfeeling” mood. Six months earlier, at the request of James White, the Byingtons had sold their long-term home in Buck's Bridge, New York, and moved to the Battle Creek area. The move involved financial loss, which caused John Byington to descend into a state of “gloom and unbelief” (Lt 28, 1859). Although Byington had previously been an active itinerant preacher, for about a year from the summer of 1858 there is no record of his filling any preaching appointments. Finally, in July 1859, after receiving challenging letters from Ellen White, he resumed his evangelistic work. “He looked happier than I had seen him for months,” Ellen noted in her diary on July 12, 1859. “Says after a week he is going out to labor for the Lord.” In 1863 Byington would be elected the first president of the newly organized General Conference.\nSee: Obituary: “John Byington,” Review, Jan. 25, 1887, pp. 57, 58; Ellen G.

Bourdeau].34 A 24-year-old French Canadian living in Vermont, Daniel T. Bourdeau had become a Sabbathkeeper about two years earlier. He was well known to the Whites since he had subsequently spent considerable time in Battle Creek translating tracts and other publications into French. He then returned to northern Vermont and at the time of this letter was a traveling preacher, mostly reaching out to the French-speaking population on both sides of the Canadian border. This letter is not in the White Estate archives.\nSee: James White, “The Present Truth in French,” Review, Dec. 24, 1857, p. 56; D. T. Bourdeau, “Letters,” Aug. 5, 1858, p. 94; search term “D. T.

Sister Lane [Sarah Lane]36 Identity: “Sister Lane” is said to come from Convis. The 1861 list of charter members for the Convis, Michigan, church includes “Thomas Lane and wife” and “Mrs. Sarah Lane,” and it seems unclear at first which of the two women is being referred to in this diary entry. Ellen White, however, adds the information that “Sister Lane” has a daughter. Of the two, only Sarah Lane had a daughter, Caroline, age 18. Thomas and Maria Lane, who married in 1856, had only one son, Charles, age 1. It therefore seems fairly certain that Sarah Lane is indicated here.\nSee: H. B. Peirce, History of Calhoun County, Michigan, pp. 154, 155; 1850 U.S. Federal Census, “Sarah Lane,” Michigan, Calhoun County, Convis, p. 179; 1860 U.S. Federal Census, “Thomas Lane,” Michigan, Calhoun County, Convis, p. 180. and her daughter, Sister Scott [Mary A. Scott],37 Identity: A few weeks later a Mary Scott from Convis wrote to the Review telling of her baptism on April 23 in Battle Creek, thus in every detail matching the information given on “Sister Scott” in Ellen White's diary. There are good reasons for concluding that this Mary Scott is Mary A. Scott, whose obituary appears in the Review of Jan. 19, 1905. Among other things, the obituary informs us that Mary A. Scott “accepted present truth … forty-six years ago” which coincides with the April 1859 date for her baptism recorded in the diary.\nSee: Mary Scott, “From Sister Scott,” Review, May 19, 1859, p. 207; obituary: “Mary A. Scott,” Review, Jan. 19, 1905, p. 23. and Sister Smith came from Convis to the meeting at Battle Creek. They took dinner at our house. Meeting was interesting through the day.

We called on Brother Tubbs [Ira B. Tubbs].49 Identity: Five males between 18 and 40 years of age with the surname “Tubbs” are listed in the 1860 census for Wright, Michigan. Four of them, probably all five, were sons of Ira Tubbs, age 60, also living in Wright. Ira and his wife, Hannah, had become Sabbatarian Adventists in 1857, but it is unclear which if any of the grown sons had joined the movement by 1859 at the time of Ellen White's visit. However, even if one or more of the sons had joined, it seems likely that Ellen White would reserve the title “Brother Tubbs” for the father, Ira.\nSee: 1850 U.S. Federal Census, “Ira Tubbs,” Michigan, Ottawa County, Wright, p. 16; 1860 U.S. Federal Census, “Philander Tubbs,” Sylvester Tubbs,” “Ira Tubbs,” Michigan, Ottawa County, Wright, pp. 118, 122. Spent a few hours in profitable conversation; then left to call on Brother and Sister Ferguson [Justus and Lucretia Ferguson].50 Identity: The information given that “Brother and Sister Ferguson” lived in or near Wright and that they had no children suggests that Ellen White is referring to Justus and Lucretia Ferguson. According to Justus Ferguson's Review obituary, he lived in Wright from about 1850 to his death in 1878, and the 1860 census affirms that the couple had no children, or at least none living at home at this time.\nSee: Obituary: “Justus Ferguson,” Feb. 7, 1878, p. 47; 1860 U.S. Federal Census, “Justen Furgeson,” Michigan, Ottawa County, Wright, p. 122. They live in a splendid house. Have no children, and all things looked rather dreary and desolate. Yet we had a profitable season of conversation and prayer before parting with them. We next went to Brother McPherson's [Samuel A. McPherson].51 Identity: The only McPhersons living in Wright Township according to the 1860 census were Samuel A.; his wife, Polly; and their children. The Review confirms that there was a Brother “S. A. McPherson” living in Wright during this period (more precisely in the village of Berlin, located within Wright township). He had started keeping the Sabbath a year earlier, in the spring of 1858.\nSee: 1860 U.S. Federal Census, “Samuel McFerson,” Michigan, Ottawa County, Wright, p. 121; S. A. McPherson, Review, “Extracts From Letters,” Apr. 7, 1859, p. 159. We were heartily received and we enjoyed the interview with them much. They are open-hearted, sound people. This brother is also wealthy, but has it all in lands,52 The 1860 and 1870 censuses list the value of Samuel McPherson's real estate at $4,000, although he may have had additional undeclared real estate assets.\nSee: 1860 U.S. Federal Census, “Samuel McFerson,” Michigan, Ottawa County, Wright, p. 121; 1870 U.S. Federal Census, “Samuel McPherson,” Michigan, Ottawa County, Polkton, p. 14. for he cannot use much."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 626","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

It had never been practiced by them,53 James White adds, in his account, that it was “Monday at 9 A. M.” when they met “to attend to the ordinances of the Lord's supper and washing of feet.” Roger Ferris in his study of Sabbatarian observance of the Communion service in the 1850s notes that it was “often celebrated in the evening” and surmises that this was because of a “sincere desire to emulate … in every detail” the Passover as it was practiced by Christ and in the Old Testament. The Whites do not appear to have prioritized such thinking, at least not in Wright, where they had spent three days, or in Caledonia two days later, where the ceremony was observed “in the afternoon” (see May 4 entry). On the observation that the ordinances “had never been practiced by them,” see under Apr. 2 above.\nSee: J. W. [James White], “Report From Bro. White,” Review, May 12, 1859, p. 197; Roger H.

On this day they came across “some natives stuck in the mud” on the road ahead. “The Indian and squaw got out and waded through the water and mud, and their famishing team drew out their papooses.” It was then the turn of the Whites to pass the muddy stretch. “We sat in the carriage, and between hope and fear watched the desperate struggles of our team, who soon took us to the dry land.”\nSee: J.

Thus “A Treatise on the Practice of Medicine” (1858 edition) advises that “Should the failing strength require further support … sometimes it becomes necessary to have recourse to the most stimulating food, as essence of beef … milk-punch, egg and wine, etc.” James White gives more detail in 1868 regarding Ellen's occasional use of this mixture. “During the past year, Mrs. W. has, at three or four times, had feelings of great debility and faintness in the morning. … To prevent distressing fainting at these times, she, immediately after rising, has taken an egg in a little pure, domestic, grape wine, perhaps a spoonful at a time. … During the past year, she may have used one pint of wine.” In later years, as methods for preserving wine/grape juice from fermentation became available, Ellen White still recommended the egg-wine mixture under certain circumstances, but this time with unfermented wine. Thus she advised Dr. Kress in 1901, severely ill with pernicious anemia: “Get eggs of healthy fowls. … Drop them uncooked into the best unfermented wine you can find. This will supply that which is necessary to your system.”\nSee: George B.

Took a wet sheet pack.60 Through the years the Whites had experimented with a range of simple remedies when illness struck. Prayer and faith in God were never thought of as excluding the use of such remedies. Ellen White's use of “a wet sheet pack” as described here is one of probably only two or three mentions of the Whites using water therapy in the 1850s. In 1855 James tried to cure his cough and painful throat and lungs through “faith in God, cold water compresses, and bathing, Hough's syrups, rest, … walking, running, horse-back riding etc.” Although water treatment (“hydropathy”) was experiencing a good deal of popularity in antebellum America, the Whites seem to have been more cautious than convinced of its value at this stage, but willing to try it. The 1860s were to see a radical change in their attitude.\nSee the following Ellen White documents with accompanying notes: Lt 8, 1849 (May 29); Lt 11, 1853 (Dec. 3); Lt 5, 1854 (Dec. 16); Ms 2, 1855 (Aug. 26).

It enlightened my mind some concerning the message to the Laodiceans.62 J. N. Loughborough notes in his diary for May 14 that on this Sabbath morning “I spoke with much freedom from the 1st Ps. ‘Pay thy vows unto the Lord.’” It is likely that the article “Vows,” by Lougborough, appearing a few weeks later (June 16) in the Review, is a transcript or summary of his May 14 sermon, since it is prefaced by the same text from Psalm 1 and the content closely follows Ellen White's description given in this diary entry.\nSee: J. N. Loughborough, “Diary,” entry for May 14; J. N. L. [J. N. Loughborough], “Vows,” Review, June 16, 1859, p. 29; EGWEnc, s.v. “Laodicean Message.” Light seemed to break into my mind that since the message to the Laodiceans has gone forth the delay that we are now in is to develop character, to bring out what is in the heart, and separate the precious from the vile.63 Ellen White is no doubt meditating on the following line of reasoning in Loughborough's sermon concerning the reason for the “delay,” as it later appeared in his Review article. “When the Laodicean message was given [late 1856], we thought surely the message of the third angel would soon go forth with a loud cry. All that were not zealous the Lord will spue out of his mouth…More than two years have passed since that message was first given. … We supposed the spueing out was immediately to come; but character must first be developed…God is weighing his people.”\nLoughborough was not the first to raise the question of the why the Laodicean message, given more than two years earlier, had not led to greater reform among members. In December 1858 M. E. Cornell reminded Review readers of “the hope [that] was entertained that this message would prepare the people for the latter rain” and asked pointedly, “Why is it not done?” Loughborough's suggested explanation found its confirmation in Ellen White's vision of June 9 (see June 4 entry below) as published in Testimony for the Church, No. 5, a week or two later. “God will prove His people. Jesus bears patiently with them, and does not spew them out of His mouth in a moment. … If the message had been of as short duration as many of us supposed, there would have been no time for them to develop character. … [God] gives them time for the excitement to wear off, and then proves them to see if they will obey the counsel of the True Witness.”\nSee: J. N. L. [J. N. Loughborough], “Vows,” Review, June 16, 1859, p. 29; M. E. Cornell, “The Laodicean Message,” Review, Dec. 16, 1858, p. 32; Ellen G.

Received two letters from Sophrona Peckham [Sophronia Peckham], giving an account of her husband's death. He had only five days’ illness. She writes that he embraced the Sabbath before his sickness. She has hopes in his death.65 Sophronia's husband, Job B. Peckham, of Volney, New York, had died on March 19, age 35. Nine years earlier, in 1850, Ellen White had warned Sophronia that Job's whole focus “was to get this world” and that “he had sapped her [spiritual] strength.” (Both spellings of her first name [“Sophronia” and “Sophrona”] appear in the sources.)\nSee: 1850 U.S. Federal Census, “Job B.

Bangs], my twin, giving an account of my niece's66 Identity: The identity of this niece is uncertain. Although speculative, what little evidence there is suggests that Ellen White is referring to her sister Harriet McCann's daughter, Melissa Tapley. According to the description given, this niece had stayed in the Harmon home for some 14 years. This could explain why the 1850 census lists a girl named “Melissa,” age 11, living in the home of Robert and Eunice Harmon even though they were both listed as 66 years old and had no daughter by that name. Adding some weight to this proposal is the fact that the birth year for this Melissa would be about 1839, which matches the year of birth of Melissa Tapley, also 1839 according to the genealogist Artemas C. Harmon. Detracting somewhat from this line of reasoning is the opinion that the niece was “not expected to recover.” Melissa Tapley confounded such predictions by living at least into her 70s, as attested by the 1910 census. However, she does seem to have had continued poor health. Ellen White noted in 1886 that Melissa “has no health, but is liable to die any time.”\nSee: 1850 U.S. Federal Census, “Robert Harmon,” Maine, Cumberland County, Gorham, p. 291; Artemas C. Harmon, ed., The Harmon Genealogy, p. 79; 1910 U.S. Federal Census, “Mellissa C. Tapley,” Maine, York County, Saco, p. 13A; Ellen G. White, Lt 95, 1886 (Feb. 16). sickness. She is not expected to recover. My mother took her when but one year and a half old, and brought her up until she was sixteen. Brother Frisbie [Joseph Birchard Frisbie] has a dispatch that his father [Elihu Frisbie] was killed the day before at ten o'clock.67 Identity: According to the obituary appearing on June 9, “Bro. E. Frisbie of Battle Creek, the aged father of Eld. Joseph B. Frisbie, was killed on the 17th ult.” He was thrown from a wagon when the team became frightened, “one of the hind wheels … striking his head immediately back of his right ear, and causing almost instant death.” In History of Washtenaw County, Michigan, E. Frisbie's first name is given as “Elihu” (p. 754) or “Elisha” (p. 778). Federal and Michigan census records tend to support “Elihu.”\nSee: Obituary: “Bro. E.

Now God is proving His people to see if they will obey Him. “Be zealous … and repent.” If they will not, He will spew them out of His mouth.

I had no desire to live, therefore I could not take hold of faith and pray for my recovery.” The crisis came one night when “I fainted at midnight. Brethren Andrews and Loughborough were sent for, and earnest petitions were offered to God in my behalf. The depression, the heavy weight was lifted from my aching heart, and I was taken off in vision.” Ellen White's biographer, Arthur White, surmises that the vision was received on June 4, but it was more likely on June 9 when J. N. Loughborough records in his diary, “at 10 p.m. I was called to go and pray for Sister White.

This inference is strengthened by the coupling of “Sister Ratel” with “Sister Daigneau,” since Marguerite Ratelle and Vitaline Daigneau were sisters as well as fellow believers. Detracting somewhat from any firm conclusion is the possibility that Ellen White is instead alluding to Vitaline Daigneau's mother-in-law, Domatile Daigneau, who also lived close by. In Lt 10, 1861 (Oct. 18), Ellen White indicates that Domatile had been an Adventist (a “sister”) at an earlier period, but it is not clear whether this was the case in 1859 when Ellen White visited “Sister Daigneau.”\nFor a comprehensive collection of local government, local press, as well as Adventist sources related to the Daigneau and Ratelle families, see Glenn Davis and Jean Davis, “Notebook, Vol. 1” (section on Daigneau).

James and Ellen White engaged themselves in raising funds for the support of the poverty-stricken Czechowski family. Appeals were made for donations in the Review and The Good Samaritan.

The value of his real estate is listed at a very sizable $15,000 in the 1850 census, and his generous and frequent donations to the Advent movement are attested to in the receipts sections of the Review.

Thus, when Ellen White states that she is writing “home to Henry, Jenny, and Willie” it is fairly clear that she is writing to Jane Frazer (usually spelled “Fraser”). According to W. C. White, Jane Fraser had joined the White household as cook sometime before 1855 while the Whites were living in Rochester, New York. She appears to have stayed with them until at least 1861 and to have had responsibility for the children when the Whites were traveling.\nSee: Ellen G.

It is most probable, therefore, that the Whites stayed with William L. Saxby and his wife, Euphemia, during their stay in Salem, Massachusetts. The only minor difficulty with this conclusion is that there is no record of W. L. Saxby living in Salem. Records place the Saxbys in Springfield, Massachusetts, until 1857, then in Worcester of the same state, and finally in Vermont by 1860.

It is strangely constructed, the seats arising from the platform. Every row of seats is one step higher or ascending. The pulpit or stand is raised only one step. A great many can be convened.45 The Lyceum Hall in Salem, Massachusetts, had been built in 1831. It “could accommodate 700 patrons in amphitheater-style seating and was decorated with images of Cicero, Demosthenes, and other great orators of bygone days.” The hall received lasting fame in 1877 when Alexander Graham Bell used it for his first public demonstration of the telephone.\nSee: Salem, Massachusetts: The City Guide, Salem Tales: Of Lectures and Lyceums (n.d.), Nov. 13, 2006, www.salemweb.com/tales/lyceum.shtml.

At two o'clock p.m. James preached again with liberty upon the unity of the church. I then talked upon the necessity of living out our profession and enduring temptation. No public meeting. In Brother S's [William L. Saxby] house for the church. James talked at length upon our acting in union to place ourselves in a position to hold property legally. Passed off with profit.46 Although the wording is unclear, it appears that this discourse on church ownership was not part of the weekend public meetings but for church members only in William Saxby's house. Until 1861 the Review and Herald publishing house was legally owned solely by James White, with all the risks attendant on such individual ownership. As stated here James clearly favored legal incorporation for the publishing house and other church buildings so that the church, not individuals, would be the corporate owner. The Whites sought to persuade church members during this autumn 1859 tour of the wisdom of “holding church property legally” and reported later that they had “found no real objections in the minds of the brethren.” During the early months of 1860 the issue was openly debated in the columns of the Review, with vigorous opposition to incorporation from some quarters.\nSee: J.

However, the 1860 census lists an “Apollus Hale” in Charlestown who was a “shoe dealer.” Ellen White's diary entry seems to suggest that they bought shoes from Brother Hale, in which case she may well be referring to Apollus (or Apollos, as his name is spelled elsewhere) Hale. One question that remains unanswered is whether this Apollos Hale of Charlestown is identical with the prominent Millerite preacher and writer of the same name. According to Millerite-Adventist historian Isaac C. Wellcome, Apollos Hale was obliged “after a time,” for health reasons, “to abandon constant preaching and devote himself to secular business.” There is some additional circumstantial evidence available, but further sources are needed to come to a definite conclusion regarding the identity of Apollos Hale of Charlestown.\nSee: Search term “Hale” in Words of the Pioneers; 1860 U.S. Federal Census, “Apollus Hale,” Massachusetts, Middlesex County, Charlestown, p. 347; Isaac C.

Although quite a few Martins are mentioned in the Review during this period, the only one for whom a Vermont address is given is in a notice from 1862 concerning “John Martin” of “Berkshire Center, Vt.” That John Martin was living in Berkshire at least two years earlier (and thus close to the time of the Whites’ 1859 visit) is shown by his appearance on the 1860 census list for Berkshire.\nSee: Ellen G.

A Brother Howlett [John Howlett],12 Identity: Apart from the description of “Brother Howlett” as “an old Methodist minister” and the fact that this meeting took place in Vermont, Ellen White adds in another place that the Howletts came from Canada (Ms 9, 1862 [Nov.]). These clues point with some certainty to John Howlett, who, according to his daughter's obituary, settled in Quebec (Canada East) and was “formerly a Methodist minister.”\nSee: Obituary: “Elizabeth Cross-Clark,” Review, Sept. 10, 1925, p. 21. an old Methodist minister, spoke.

Buck],13 Identities: The narrative sequence of this entry—James “preached,” Ellen “bore my testimony,” an old Methodist minister “spoke,” and Brother Stone and Brother Buck “and other brethren bore testimony”—suggests that Stone and Buck might be preachers. James White, in his report, reinforces this impression by listing Stone and Buck together with A. C. and D. T. Bourdeau and M. B. Czechowski, who were well-known ministers: “At Berkshire we met brethren Stone, Buck, Taylor, A. C. and D. T. Bourdeau, and our good Bro. Czechowski. … We spoke to them [the audience] twice on the Sabbath, and four times on first-day.” The only Stone and Buck that fit this description are Albert Stone and Harry G.

He related to us that when he came to the meeting, his wife told him unless he would promise that he would not keep the Sabbath she would not live with him. He would not promise, and they lodged separately. Poor man, he has been much troubled. His wife's father was very violent. Would strike him. His children joined them.

Spalding considered it “probably” the first church to be built by Sabbatarian Adventists. In recent years, however, Brian Strayer has pointed to a letter by Joseph Bates in the Review that indicates that a church had been built in Jackson, Michigan, a year earlier, in 1854.\nSee: Arthur Whitefield Spalding, Origin and History of Seventh-day Adventists, vol. 1, pp. 222, 403; Brian E.

M. Ballou,” so the initial question is whether any person by that name lived in Mannsville or vicinity, where he met the Whites. The 1850 census does have a “James M. Ballou” listed in the nearby township of Boylston. Depending on where in Boylston James Ballou lived, it could have been as close as three or four miles (five kilometers) from Mannsville. The likelihood, therefore, is that Ellen White is referring to James M. Ballou. His full name is given in his obituary.\nSee: Search term “Ballou” in Words of the Pioneers; 1850 U.S. Federal Census, “James M.

According to the 1860 census, both Alonzo Miles and Randolph Miles with their families lived in the Ellisburg township, in which Mannsville is located. The information given in the October 22 entry that “Brother and Sister Miles once joined the Messenger [Party]” strongly suggests that the “Brother Miles” Ellen White is referring to is Alonzo Miles. Five years earlier Alonzo Miles (then living in Illinois) had written a rather brusque letter to the Review saying that he had received the Messenger Party paper, Messenger of Truth, and asked whether, as it claimed, the visions of Ellen White were becoming a test of fellowship among Sabbathkeepers. After that nothing is heard of Alonzo Miles in the Review—no letters or subscription receipts—until 1860 when a subscription is again receipted, suggesting that he had returned to the “Battle Creek” Sabbatarians. There is no evidence that Randolph Miles, probably Alonzo's brother, ever defected to the Messenger Party.\nSee: 1860 U.S. Federal Census, “Alonzo Miles,” New York, Jefferson County, Ellisburg, p. 46; 1860 U.S. Federal Census, “R.

Loughborough's diary entries clarify the intent of this somewhat imprecise statement. It appears that the Whites first traveled south from Grand Rapids on the plank road toward Kalamazoo for about 14 miles (22 kilometers), after which, however, they had to turn off the plank and drive the last ten miles (16 kilometers) to Monterey on a really poor road. The Grand Rapids-Kalamazoo plank road had been built in the mid-1850s and had no doubt deteriorated in time, thus making it a “very rough ride” for the Whites in 1859. Mark Twain is said to have quipped after traveling this same plank road that he would have enjoyed the trip had not “some unconscionable scoundrel” “now and then dropped a plank across it.”\nSee: J.

Having given the address of “Brother Hastings,” it is safe to conclude that she is addressing Leonard W. Hastings, of New Ipswich, New Hampshire, the only person who fits the description. The style of the greeting and letter that follows suggests that “Amelia” and “Emma” are family members. At the time of writing, Leonard Hastings’ wife and oldest daughter had died. Two females remained in the family whose names are given as “Sarah A.” and “Emma A.” in the 1850 census, aged about 20 and 18, respectively. In the greeting “Emma” corresponds with the “Emma A.” of the census, but “Amelia” is more difficult to account for. Most likely the “A.” of “Sarah A.” stands for Amelia, and she was known by her middle name. Strengthening this conclusion is a letter by Joseph Bates written in 1858 in which he also lists “Emma” and “Amelia” among the Hastings family members.\nSee: Ellen G.

This assumption is strengthened by the close parallel between the admonitions found in this letter and those specifically directed to members of the Joseph Benedict family in 1862 (see note in third paragraph). By 1859 Joseph Benedict was chronically ill and unable to work. James and Ellen White tried to help the poverty-stricken family with gifts of food and money and by occasionally employing Joseph's wife, Millie, and daughter Diantha (see Diantha Wilkinson [née Benedict]) in their home or at the Review office (see Mss 5 and 6, 1859 [entries for Jan. 5 and June 12])."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 664.3","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

In 1855, for example, Ellen White, on a visit to Palmyra, Maine, described how Betsey “longed to keep the Sabbath,” whereas John wavered. As Adventist historian James R. Nix has pointed out, even after John White became a Sabbatarian he “concurrently, for the next several years … continued to be a member of the Christian Church in Marshall, Michigan.”\nSee: James White and Ellen G.

This interpretation is not entirely without problems because the evidence suggests that the Bates did not move into the Monterey house until early 1860 (see above citation), which seems to conflict with Ellen White's statement that the problem arose “about one year ago,” i.e., in 1858. Another possibility would be that James White had made a house available to the Bates in 1858 before the move to Monterey in 1860. This may or may not be related to Joseph Bates's later testimony that “at one time” James White “furnished me with a house for my family for fourteen months, for which he refused to receive rent.”\nJohn Byington was clearly unhappy and felt that James White's leadership had been compromised by what he considered a display of unjust favoritism toward Joseph Bates. In response to this charge Ellen White responded in another letter to Byington: “God's ways are equal. He does not require one to sacrifice everything and another to make no sacrifice at all.” In terms of sacrifice, as Joseph Bates's biographer George R. Knight describes it, Bates had been living “on the financial edge” while carrying on a full-time itinerant ministry ever since the mid-1840s, when he donated his life savings of $8,000 to $10,000 dollars to the cause of preaching the Millerite message. It should also be noted that Bates later willed the house that had been given him in Monterey to the Seventh-day Adventist Publishing Association.\nSee: John Nevins Andrews et al., Defense of Elder James White and Wife, p. 24; George R.

It contained reproof for John Byington's “love of this world,” which had led him to disengage from active ministry. In particular he had been discouraged by financial losses incurred during his move from New York to Michigan in late 1858, and by envy when James White arranged for Joseph Bates to be given a house. Byington's response to her letter of reproof apparently was quite negative, as judged by the previous paragraph. This letter (Lt 28, 1859), responding to Byington's negative reaction, refers again to the specific themes of the June 21 letter—the move from New York, John Bates's house, etc.—thus suggesting that it was written fairly soon after June 21. A comparison with Ellen White's diary would seem to indicate that this second letter to Byington had its intended effect. In an entry on July 12 she reported that Byington “looked happier than I had seen him for months. Says after a week he is going out to labor for the Lord, and expects to be absent six months. Thank the Lord for this.” Thus this letter, it can be assumed, was written sometime before July 12, 1859.\nSee: Ellen G. White, Ms 7, 1859 (July 12 entry). I was very cautious that not a word I should say should wound, but that the facts should be related as simply as possible, and they cut. I knew if you realized the matter as it was shown me you would nearly despair, and with strong cries and humble repentance you would seek the forgiveness and favor of God."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 677.2","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world, for if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.”4 John Byington was clearly apprehensive about having his moral failings published. It may be that he felt rebuked by the recently published Testimony for the Church, No. 5, even though it did not specifically mention his name. In the first section of the pamphlet Ellen White pressed home the theme that “the greatest sin which now exists in the church is covetousness. God frowns upon His professed people for their selfishness” (Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, p. 194). Although many of the visions pertaining to individuals were published in the Testimonies series through the years, Ellen White in general removed personal names from these accounts. In the earliest Testimony pamphlets, often only the initial of the person's surname was used. For a discussion of Ellen White's publication of personal names in 1861, see Arthur L. White, Ellen G.

The move, Ellen White indicates here, had entailed financial loss, though details are not known. One possible indication of loss is found in comparing the value of Byington's real estate in 1850—a comfortable $4,000—with that in 1860, after the move to Michigan, when it was down to $1,600.\nSee: Obituary: “John Byington,” Review, Jan. 25, 1887, p. 57; John and Catherine Byington, “Note to Sister Rice,” Review, May 19, 1859, p. 206; 1850 U.S. Federal Census, “John Byington,” New York, St. Lawrence County, Potsdam, p. 39; 1860 U.S. Federal Census, “John Byington,” Michigan, Calhoun County, Newton, p. 244.

The 1860 statement also associates “Fletcher” with the “Office,” indicating that the reference is to John Fletcher Byington, who had worked at the Review and Herald press since 1853. Ellen White commonly referred to him by his second name, no doubt to distinguish him from his father, John Byington.\nSee: Ellen G.

By the following summer the situation had deteriorated to the point where James White severed his connection with the office for a time and an ad hoc “General Council” had to convene in June 1860 to deal with the crisis. The council published a pamphlet that included the report that Uriah Smith, among others, had apologized and made “very humble acknowledgements.” For a discussion on the involvement of Harriet Smith (wife of Uriah) in these troubles, see Letters 7 and 8, 1860 (June; June 11). Both Gerald Wheeler and Eugene Durand include sections in their respective biographies of White and Smith on the occasionally turbulent relationships between Uriah Smith and James White.\nSee: S. T.

Paradoxically, the Cyrenius Smith family is mainly remembered by Adventist historians for their earlier generosity toward the fledgling church. In 1852, according to J. N. Loughborough, the Smiths sold their farm in order to free up cash to use for church projects. In 1855 when funds were needed to erect a building to house the Review and Herald press in Battle Creek, Michigan, Smith joined with others to lend $300 toward the project.\nSee: J. N.

Beginning in 1858 James White appealed to Review readers to make the new venture possible by providing financial support to Czechowski's poverty-stricken wife and children. It seems that Louisa and Cyrenius Smith were less than enthusiastic about helping the Czechowski family. I am not mistaken in this matter. Perhaps you do not see it so, but God regards it so.

Cranson, a Sabbatarian preacher, died in 1855 at age 33, leaving his wife, Mary, with three children aged about 8, 6, and 4. In accordance with her husband's plans, Mary subsequently moved from Jackson County to Battle Creek, hoping for moral and perhaps material support from the congregation at the church's headquarters. Like her husband, Mary Cranson contracted tuberculosis and by August 1859 was so weakened that she was unable to look after her household and children. She was also impoverished. The Battle Creek church stepped in and voted to support her with $3 per week. The following summer, James White organized additional fund raising for the Cranson family through the Review. Mary Jane Cranson died August 27, 1860, aged 35.\nSee: Obituary, “Samuel T. Cranson,” Review, May 1, 1855, p. 222; obituary: “Mary Jane Cranson,” Review, Sept. 18, 1860, p. 143; 1860 U.S. Federal Census, “Mary J.

There are those who have not made her case their own.3 Among those in Battle Creek who had been less than helpful to Mrs. Cranson were Cyrenius and Louisa Smith. Using the same words as found here, Ellen White challenged the Smiths in another letter: “I have seen that Sister Cranson has not received from you that heartfelt sympathy that her case required. You have not made her case your own.” As was often the case with other visions she received, Ellen White would write separate letters to individuals pointed out in the vision and then write a general description, without mentioning specific names, to the local church concerned.\nSee: Ellen G. White, Lt 32, 1859 (July 9). Some have seen the wrongs in her children and have not been as tender and careful of her feelings in the matter as they should have been, while at the same time those who have been more favorably situated have not half realized, and corrected as they should, their own children's wrongs. Her widowed heart has had many solitary, desolate, agonizing hours that others have known nothing about.

You remember, Willie, it is where they make candy.4 There is some evidence that Willie had accompanied his parents the previous year on their tour of the Eastern states, which included a visit to the Folsoms in Somerville.

The fact that here she says it was written from Charlestown could be explained by the fact that Somerville and Charlestown adjoined each other and had been one town prior to 1842. Whatever the case, this letter to Jenny has not been preserved. Thursday we rode on the [railroad] cars to Salem [Massachusetts], the place of our next meeting. Made our home at Brother Saxby's [William L. Saxby].5 Identity: A short note appearing two weeks earlier in the Review is helpful in identifying “Brother Saxby”: “W. L. Saxby: Bro. White will see you on his eastern tour, in regard to press.” The only W. L. Saxby mentioned in the Review is William L. Saxby who lived in Massachusetts during this period. It is most probable, therefore, that the Whites stayed with William L. Saxby and his wife, Euphemia, during their stay in Salem, Massachusetts. The only minor difficulty with this solution is that there is no record of W. L. Saxby living in Salem. Records place the Saxbys in Springfield, Massachusetts, until 1857, then in Worcester of the same state, and finally in Vermont by 1860. Nevertheless it is likely that the Saxbys lived in Salem before moving to Vermont in 1860.\nSee: “Business Notes,” Review, Aug. 25, 1859, p. 112; search term “Saxby” in Words of the Pioneers; 1860 U.S. Federal Census, “William L. Saxby,” Vermont, Franklin County, Enosburgh, p. 43. They were attentive to our wants. Brother and Sister Hutchins [Alfred S. and Esther M. Hutchins]6 Identity: From remarks made further down it is clear that “Brother Hutchins” took part in the preaching during the Salem meetings. Three weeks later itinerant preacher A. S. Hutchins reported in the Review how he and his wife had come to Salem and met the Whites. “We left Maine to meet Bro. and Sr. White in Salem, Mass., where we were happy to meet them again.”\nSee: A. S. Hutchins, “Report From Bro. Hutchins,” Review, Oct. 6, 1859, p. 157. came Thursday. Brother Hutchins is quite well. Sister Hutchins is about as usual, but both have good appetites. This is favorable for them. They are in good spirits, enjoying the blessing of God. Brother Nichols [Otis Nichols]7 Identity: It seems most likely that either Otis Nichols or his son Henry O. Nichols had come from their home in Dorchester, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) distant, to attend the weekend meetings in Salem. No other male members with the surname “Nichols” living in the Boston area at this time are mentioned in the Review. Ellen White always addressed Otis Nichols as “Brother Nichols” and his son as “Henry,” so no doubt Otis Nichols is intended here. Earlier the same day Otis Nichols had driven the Whites to the train station in Boston for the trip to Dartmouth.\nSee: Search term “Nichols” in Words of the Pioneers; Ms 7, 1859 (Sept. 15 entry). seems as good as ever.

An extreme interpretation of the Laodicean message (see EGWEnc) was being urged by some church members and leaders, including the Graham brothers, pressing for speedy confession and reformation among those members who were judged to be delinquent. Those unwilling or unable to comply promptly were thought to have been “spued out of the mouth of the Lord” (see Rev. 3:16) and consequently were ostracized by the rest of the group. In Lt 19 Ellen White condemned this “hurried, fanatical spirit,” arguing that those behind it should “wait patiently for the Lord to test character and to spue out the lukewarm” rather than taking that “work into their own hands.” Essentially, Lt 7 surveys the cases of several Connecticut members who were being pressed to confess or who were thought to be already rejected by God. Ellen White testifies that God had not given up on these persons and, furthermore, that the whole campaign was “cruel work” having “God's frown … upon it.” See also Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, pp. 186-188, published some months earlier, in which Ellen White warned of various distortions of the Laodicean message."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 711.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

(Wilcox's first name is given later in the paragraph.) There is strong evidence that the maiden name of Mary S. Wilcox was Mary S. North. In the 1870 census John Wilcox, age 37, and Mary Wilcox, 47, living in Berlin, Connecticut, have in their household not only two sons but also “Marinda North,” age 70. Likely Marinda North was Mary's mother, who had come to live with her daughter and son-in-law after becoming a widow. Earlier censuses confirm that Marinda North was the mother of Mary Wilcox. The 1850 census shows a family by the name of “North” in Berlin that included Joseph, age 54, Marinda, 51, and Mary, 27. The 1860 census has the same names, Joseph, 65, Marinda, 60, and Mary, 37. Note that the ages of Marinda and Mary fit almost perfectly in all three censuses. Finally, there is evidence that Joseph North was a Sabbathkeeper, as was Mary North. In the Review from the 1850s there is notice of a conference to be held “at the house of Bro. Joseph North” in Berlin, and also several mentions of an “M. S. North” (Mary S.[?]).\nSee: Obituary: “John Y.

T. Evans].2 Identities: The fact that both of these men are from Vermont and have engaged in some preaching makes it easy to identify them. A survey of the Review from this period reveals that only Lewis Bean and D. T. Evans fit that description. Lewis Bean's father, Samuel W. Bean, was also a Sabbathkeeper, but there is no hint that he had engaged in any preaching. Lewis Bean worked as a “wheelwright” and “carriage maker” and D. T. Evans was a “shoemaker,” but they also undertook lay preaching and, apparently, at this time aspired to full-time public evangelism.\nSee: Search terms “Bean” and “Evans” in Words of the Pioneers; 1850 U.S. Federal Census, “Lewis Bean,” Vermont, Caledonia County, Hardwick, p. 195; 1860 U.S. Federal Census, “Lewis Bean,” Vermont, Lamoille County, Stowe, p. 264; 1850 U.S. Federal Census, “Derrick T. Evans,” Vermont, Orange County, Corinth, p. 152. If God has called them, the weight and burden of the message will rest in power upon them, and their gift will not be exercised among believers only, but the great burden of their work will be to go out in new fields and raise up a company to keep the truth. But I saw that these brethren had not understood their work fully. God has not called them to give themselves unreservedly to the work. Oh, no, they can assist in the work and do errands for the Lord, but they should not feel to throw themselves on the church as messengers or as called and chosen servants of Jesus to travel from place to place, or State to State, to labor and preach.3 Reasons that Bean and Evans were unsuited to full-time itinerant ministry are set forth in Lts 20 and 21, 1859 (c. Sept. 24). Their time should not be occupied visiting the different churches; they do no good this way in traveling from church to church. The churches generally are just as well off without them. They have a duty to do in case ministers are absent, to baptize or administer the ordinances.4 It is probable that both Bean and Evans had been ordained as local elders. This statement, therefore, should not be understood as a sanction for unordained laypersons to administer baptism and the Lord's Supper. In 1854, for example, Ellen White had held up the example of the New Testament church, where men were “set apart by the laying on of hands” and then went “forth baptizing … and to administer the ordinances of the Lord's house.” It seems likely that Ellen White here was simply expressing the judgment that Bean and Evans were qualified for the responsibilities of church elders but not for the wider preaching duties of traveling ministers. A church elder, as his duties were formally described in 1861, “may conduct the meetings of the church, and administer the ordinances of baptism and the Lord's supper in the absence of any higher officer.” An elder's authority to baptize would later become more restricted.\nSee: Ellen G. White, Supplement to the Christian Experience and Views of Ellen G. White, p. 19; J. N. Loughborough, Moses Hull, M. E. Cornell, “Conference Address. Organization,” Review, Oct. 15, 1861, p. 157; George R. Knight, “Early Seventh-day Adventists and Ordination, 1844-1863,” in Nancy Vyhmeister, ed., Women in Ministry: Biblical and Historical Perspectives, pp. 108, 109. It is pleasant to visit the brethren and churches of Sabbathkeepers, but still the church is just as well off without such laborers, unless they have a special message to deliver. These should be careful of their time when they are not on a special errand for God, [and] labor with their hands, [doing] the thing that is good.5 The trend of thought here seems to be that Bean and Evans should not strain the financial resources of the churches they visited, the practice at the time being that local churches would remunerate visiting preachers for their expenses. Rather, these men should support themselves by their respective trades and make only occasional preaching forays. As to whether Bean and Evans heeded the instruction given them in the years that followed, see notes on Lt 20, 1859 (Bean) and Lt 21, 1859 (Evans), both written circa September 24, 1859. In brief, it may be noted that during the following five years D. T. Evans showed no indication of heeding the testimony. In 1864 Ellen White took the exceptional step of discussing his case in the pamphlet Testimony for the Church, No. 10 (Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, pp. 448, 449), although his name appeared only in the first printing. Lewis Bean, on the other hand, followed the counsel more closely. Rather than pursuing a preaching vocation, he served the church for many years as a member of the Vermont Conference executive committee and as conference president for five years."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 715.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

For many years during the 1860s and 1870s he served on the executive committee of the Vermont Conference, and for five years, from 1870 to 1875, was conference president. Although he held ministerial credentials during most of the 1870s, after he became conference president there is little evidence in the Review that he engaged in public evangelism.

An 1860 date can be excluded, however, because the letter was written on a journey that lasted more than eight weeks (see first line), and no such trip was undertaken by her that year. In 1858 the Whites traveled on a lengthy autumn itinerary, but it appears that Willie accompanied them (see note 4 in Lt 9, 1859), so no letters were called for.

However, they can be harmonized. In the second example Ellen White seems to be speaking about God's love in the sense of His unconditional benevolence. Another standard dictionary definition of “love” is “to be pleased with” something or somebody. Clearly, God does not take pleasure in children or older persons when they engage in evil behavior. This seems the more natural interpretation of “love” when Ellen White urges Willie to remember that “the Lord could not love you if you should be naughty.” For a more comprehensive discussion of this issue, together with bibliographical references, see Ms 1, 1854 (Feb. 12), note 19.

However, no sources have been found connecting a Chamberlain with such activities. More generally, the letter focuses on the activities and concerns of certain members living in Hartford County, Connecticut, thus implying that “Sister Chamberlain” was acquainted with these persons and probably was living in the same area herself. Two residents of Connecticut, mentioned in the Review during the 1850s, are Helen Chamberlain, from Windham County, and Mary Ann Chamberlain, living in Middletown, Hartford County. The latter person is likely the one to whom this letter was written, living, as she did, in the epicenter of the events described. Mary Ann was the widow of E.L.H.

The central theme is how the call for repentance in the Laodicean message had been distorted and misapplied in Connecticut (Lts 7, 19) and New York (Lts 16, 17). My soul was wrung with keen anguish as I saw the state of things.

No time was granted individuals to develop character. Angels of God were patiently waiting to weigh moral worth, and to mark the development of character. But some went ahead of the angels and were burdened and exercised because the work was not closed up at once. They did not wait patiently for the Lord to test character and to spue out the lukewarm, but took that work into their own hands; and unless they could see individuals coming up to the point they thought they should reach, they pushed them off.5 In the period after the autumn of 1856, when Sabbatarian Adventists had first begun to apply the Laodicean message (see EGWEnc) of Revelation 3 to their own movement, the call for repentance and wholehearted engagement had been positively received by many members. However, some, instead of pursuing personal reformation, turned their attention to the failings of fellow members. An extreme interpretation of the Laodicean message, condemned in this letter, pressed for speedy confession and reformation among members judged to be delinquent. Those unwilling or unable to promptly comply were thought to have been “spued out of the mouth of the Lord” (see Rev. 3:16) and consequently were ostracized by the rest of the group. A fear came over them—fear to associate with the ones they thought spued out of the mouth of the Lord. Why did they not read the connection—Rev. 3:18-22?

All three are listed in the 1860 census of Berlin Township, in which Kensington is located. Census details strongly suggest that they were brothers. Further, the only Grahams in the Review of the 1850s who had Connecticut addresses are these three men.

It was in his own spirit he came to you. His influence over you and the burning of those pictures11 Although not mentioning E. L. Barr by name, James White no doubt had him, among others, in mind when he complained in the next Review of those preachers who had “run from place to place on the cars, encouraging a fanatical spirit in burning daguerreotypes &c., worse than wasting their Lord's money, and leaving the brethren in distraction.” Originating in France in 1839, daguerreotype photographs achieved their greatest popularity in the United States in the 1840s and 1850s. Prices for a medium-size portrait in the early 1850s ranged from 50 cents to $2, depending on quality. At a time when unskilled labor averaged about $1.00 a day in the Midwest and $1.10 in the Northeast this was a considerable outlay, although more affordable for the middle classes. Part of Barr's criticism was that the daguerreotype craze had led members to use scarce funds that could have been better spent, and on this point both Ellen and James White would no doubt have agreed. Barr's problem, his “fanatical spirit,” was to go to extremes and press for the burning of daguerreotypes owned by members.\nSee: J. W.

She recalls the time he assisted in tent meetings, probably those in Illinois during the summer of 1857 (the only tent meetings involving Phillips reported on in the Review). “You were not what God required you to be when you went around with the tent. Your love of ease … led you to shun responsibilities and shirk the burdens upon others.

The uncertainty lies in the fact that Byington's school failed and closed down “after a brief and stormy experience.” According to W. C.

It was not until 1861-1862 that Rhodes revealed the full story. Rhodes was not alone in trying to keep Ellen White's reproofs secret and in doing little to implement called-for changes.

Revival had followed, as evidenced by many letters and articles on the Laodicean message in the Review during 1857. In some churches, however, the call to repent had led to an unhealthy concern over the shortcomings of fellow church members and to a rash of church disciplinary proceedings. Ellen White had addressed the churches of central New York in July 1857 (Ms 2, 1857) on this particular issue.\nSee: EGWEnc, s.v. “Laodicean Message.” This was not their work; and while they were thus engaged they got into a worse condition than those whom they were reproving. I saw it was an individual work. “Be zealous and repent.” One is not to repent for his brother or sister, but for his own wrongs. Some have looked at and watched others and thought they were not moving fast enough—they did not move just to suit their idea of right—and impressions and burdens followed that God did not dictate.

A hint that Ellen White is writing of Alexander and not Manley is found a few lines farther down. “I saw that Brother Ross could do errands for the Lord, but his brethren are so fearful that Brother Ross will get exalted …” Ellen White several times uses the expression “do errands for the Lord” to describe lay preachers who are capable of part-time ministry and local leadership but who are not called to travel extensively or to “throw themselves wholly on the church as called and chosen servants of Jesus Christ.” The suggestion then is that “Brother Ross” is in some minor position of leadership. This description fits Alexander Ross well. He preached, mostly locally, organized local tent meetings, and served as agent for the Review. There is no mention of his brother Manley filling any leadership positions.\nSee: Search term “Ross” in Words of the Pioneers; Ellen G.

Everything was shown that was needed to correct the evil. But in Ohio again these things were presented before me,11 While in Green Springs, Ohio, in late February/early March 1858, Ellen White had a vision concerning problems of “wrangling and strife” in Oswego County, New York (which included Roosevelt).\nSee: Ellen G.

W. Rhodes is the “Brother Rhodes” in this passage. Rhodes's negative influence on churches in Michigan and New York is well documented in several earlier visions of Ellen White.\nSee: Ellen G.

I saw that the same spirit existed there at Roosevelt, and was pointed back to where Brother Truman Finch [Truman P. Finch] was connected with these things and saw that what he had to do was to correct his wrong course and remove the influence he had cast.13 See: Ellen G. White, Lt 8, 1857 (July 19), for another reference to Truman Finch's influence on the Roosevelt church. And at the same time I saw that the wrong course of the church at Roosevelt had not yet been corrected and confessed. There was a great fear that if confessions of wrongs should be made, it would build up those who were thought to be wrong on the other side, and for fear of this there has been a scrinching, a shrinking from duty, that should have been immediately attended to when the message was given in Ulysses.14 A reference to Ellen White's vision in Ulysses, Pennsylvania, given two years earlier, containing admonition to the Roosevelt church for their internal dissension and numerous “church trials.”\nSee: Ellen G.

It was needed to bring the cause into a position where it would not languish and sink.2 Throughout the 1850s James White, with the support of Ellen, had been at the forefront of every major new church venture. With his strong leadership and administrative talents he tended to micromanage every aspect of the movement, and this lead to exhaustion. The focus of this vision, that James should shed some of his many tasks and focus on “speaking and writing,” was, for a number of reasons, never to become a reality. In 1871, for example, James White was not only reelected General Conference president, but also elected “editor of the Review and the Health Reformer, president of the Publishing Association, president of the Seventh-day Adventist Benevolent Association, and president of the Missionary Society.”\nSee: Virgil Robinson, James White, p. 230.

By 1858, however, James White reported that not only had the Messenger Party challenge faded away, but during the years of conflict paid subscriptions to the Review had almost doubled from 1,000 to near 2,000.\nSee: Virgil Robinson, James White, p. 230.

When G. I. Butler in 1873 tried to steer the General Conference toward giving James White special authority and preeminence, he (White) successfully counteracted the attempt. Andrew Mustard traces the issue of leadership authority during this period in James White and SDA Organization, pp. 175-178. Angels of God have charge of the work, and they counsel and direct the people through chosen agents and thus the work moves forward. I was shown that God in His own wise providence raised James above dependence and want that his testimony and influence might not be crippled by the galling sense of dependence.6 As J. N. Andrews and others noted some years later: “When Eld. White, in 1848, began the business of publishing, in Middletown, Conn., he did it without any capital at all, and almost without friends. … He was dependent upon a few friends in quite humble circumstances for a shelter and for the necessities of life.” During the early 1850s, while in Rochester, New York, “he lived in a hired house … [that] was furnished with the plainest articles of second-hand furniture. The food of his family was of the least expensive character.” After the move to Michigan in 1855, James White's personal financial situation began to improve.\nSee: J. N. Andrews et al, Defense of Elder James White and Wife, pp. 2, 3. For a recent analysis of his sources of personal income, see Gerald Wheeler, James White, pp. 72, 81, 147-153.

I was pointed back and saw that amid all the hatred and devices of Satan, God had spared the life of James, although Satan has pressed him sore to take it away.7 Although James White had survived a number of crises, the one that Ellen White described with the most pathos took place during the winter of 1854-1855 and continued through most of 1855. James was, she wrote, “fiercely buffeted by Satan” during this period. She greatly feared that he was fast heading “to a consumptive's grave” and that her “three little boys” would “be left fatherless.” “Three times a day we went alone before God … in earnest prayer for the recovery of his health. … The Lord graciously heard our earnest cries, and my husband began to recover.”\nSee: Ellen G.

At a subsequent meeting in Portland, Maine, Joseph Turner was present when Ellen Harmon in vision spoke of Turner's “ungodly course.” Turner rejected this part of her testimony, and Ellen Harmon left the meeting “with anguish of spirit.” She then went to see Turner's wife, and it is there that the narrative picks up in the first paragraph.\nSee: Ellen G. White, Spiritual Gifts [vol. 2], p. 49. She was weeping as though her heart would break. She there confirmed the vision which I related to her.4 Many years later Ellen White gave further details regarding the contents of this vision. It showed Turner “transgressing the commandments, giving attention to other women, and his wife suffering under the great strain.” His distraught wife confirmed the vision relating how her husband would sometimes spend “half the night, and sometimes all night” with Sarah Jordan, sister of William Jordan, “giving her visions.” Ellen White attributed Sarah's “so-called visions” to Turner's “mesmeric passes.” She also related how, sometime later, while in a meeting in Poland, Maine, Turner unsuccessfully tried to “mesmerize” her.\nSee: EGWEnc, s.v. “Hypnosis and Mesmerism”; Ellen G.

He publicly renounced this position in early 1846. Amid the Adventist theological controversies of the late 1840s and the 1850s, Howell sided with the conditionalists and joined the Advent Christians. Howell's wife, Lucinda S. Howell (later Burdick), was also an active opponent of Ellen White.\nSee: “John Howell,” 1860 U.S. Federal Census, Vermont, Rutland County, Poultney, p. 272; David Tallmadge Arthur, “‘Come out of Babylon,’” p. 334; John Howell, “Letter From Bro.

These fanatical ones seemed to think that religion consisted in making a noise, being boisterous, rough, and talking in such a manner as to irritate and cause unbelievers to hate them, and then would rejoice that they suffered persecution.9 Some have rejected statements such as these in which Ellen White claims to have campaigned against “fanaticism” of various kinds in 1845. Such claims, it is said, are conscious or unconscious attempts by Ellen White, many years after the events of 1845, to deny her close association, together with James White, with the fanaticism of the period. However, it needs to be remembered that there is contemporary evidence already from the summer of 1845 showing the opposition of James White (by now closely associated with Ellen Harmon) to the fanatical excesses of some Adventists in Maine. In a letter written by James White on August 19, 1845, and published in the Day-Star, he regretfully affirms that there is “much ground” for the charges of “fanaticism” and that “many of our best brethren were led away from the truths of the blessed Bible.”\nSee: Ann Taves, Fits, Trances, and Visions, pp. 159-161; James White, “Letter From Bro. White,” Day-Star, Sept. 6, 1845, pp. 17, 18.

Burdick, by Marion C. S. Truesdail,” Aug. 17, 1875 (DF 266, EGWE-GC). Unbelievers were enraged. They could see no consistency in this wild spirit and they made stringent rules that no advent believer should come into town. The innocent here suffered with the guilty. They could not have the privilege of assembling to encourage one another, for even the citizens of the place who were believers were denied this privilege. Sentinels were on the watch to hinder all who should attempt to enter the town.10 At a town meeting in Orrington on June 25, 1845, i.e., about the same period as Ellen Harmon's second visit described in this letter, action was taken to specifically forbid out-of-town Millerites from entering the town. It was “voted that the selectmen prosecute all persons who come into town and are represented as Idle persons, Brawlers and false pretenders going about town and seducing its inhabitants to the same courses of conduct.” The designations “Idle persons” and “Brawlers” were common legal terms used against Millerites during this period. The high level of public feeling against visiting Millerites is illustrated by an incident three months earlier, at the end of March 1845, in Atkinson, some 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Orrington. According to newspaper reports “a band of men disguised as Indians … forced the doors of a ‘Miller’ meeting in Atkinson and seized and carried off several persons not supposed to belong to the town and threatened to tar and feather the adventists if they held any more meetings.”\nSee: Orrington town records, June 25, 1845, Article 2, meeting moderated by Justice of the Peace Joseph Doane; “Atrocious Conduct,” Whig and Courier (Bangor, Maine), Mar. 29, 1845.

Of greater interest is a notice appearing in several local and out-of-state newspapers on April 28, 1845, and subsequently, reporting that a “Mr. George W. Brown, of Orrington” among other “professors of … belief” in “Millerism” had been arrested. It is therefore at least possible that “Brother B's house,” which Ellen White visited on this occasion, was that of George W. Brown.\nSee: “Miller Excitement,” Whig and Courier (Bangor, Maine), Feb. 19, 1845; “Millerism,” Daily Argus (Portland, Maine), Apr. 28, 1845; “Millerism,” Eastern Argus (Portland, Maine), Apr. 28, 1845; “Millerism,” New York Daily Tribune, May 2, 1845. family in Orrington. They heartily welcomed us to their home and hearts. Every moment was precious to these hungry children and we sat up till a late hour recounting the trials we had passed through and the refreshing seasons we had enjoyed; and we deplored together the sad state of the cause. I bore a sad and aching heart. It seemed so cruel that the cause of Christ should be injured by injudicious men. Not only were the men injuring their own souls but placing a stigma upon the cause which would not be easily wiped away. Satan was willing to have it so. It suited well his satanic majesty to see the truth mixed with error and then altogether trampled in the dust.

White, Life Sketches (1880), p. 202. visited Claremont (New Hampshire), and] inquired for Adventists. We were told that there were two parties, one holding fast their past advent experience, the other had denied it.3 Within some months of the passing of October 22, 1844, most Adventists had come to deny that the October date had any prophetic significance or that the “seventh month movement,” which led up to it, was ordained of God in any special sense. Ellen White's visions, however, supported the minority Adventist position, championed by Joseph Turner and Apollos Hale, that October 22 represented a fulfillment of prophecy, i.e., they were “holding fast their advent experience.” For a brief survey of divisions among Adventists in 1845, see George R. Knight, Millennial Fever and the End of the World, pp. 236-242. We stated that we wished to find those who had not denied their past experience, and were directed to Elders B—t [Bennett] and B—s [Billings]4 Identities: In the original handwritten draft of this manuscript Ellen White did not provide the full names of these two elders, giving only the first and last letters of their surnames. The same format appears in Spiritual Gifts [vol. 2], her earliest full autobiographical account published in 1860. However, in an edited and amplified version of her experiences first published in 1880 (Life Sketches), the names of the two elders appear in full as “Elders Bennett and Bellings.” Variant spellings, “Bennet” and “Billings,” are found in Ellen White's later (1904) memories of these events. The exact identity of the two men is difficult to establish since there were several Millerite Adventists with similar names associated with Claremont, New Hampshire, about the time of Ellen White's visit. Thus, Millerite papers from the mid-1840s feature, among others, “Leonard F. Billings,” “A. M. Billings,” “John Billings,” “J. G. Bennet,” and “J. G. Bennett,” all said to come from Claremont. There may be some grounds for holding that Ellen White was referring to J. G. Bennett and A. M. Billings, since the Advent Herald in 1844 reported that they preached together as a team: “Bro. J. G. Bennet, of Claremont, N. H … is associated with Bro. A. M. Billings … [who] are now holding Conferences and Camp-meetings continually.”\nSee: Ellen G.

Several of Ellen White's letters from 1869 outline the antipathy to James White on the part of Martha Amadon, Harriet Smith, and Cornelia Cornell during this period, to the point where “it would have been good news, had you heard my husband was dead.” All three women were married to prominent church leaders, who in turn had been influenced by their negative views. Letters from Ellen White to George Amadon in the 1890s and early 1900s show that she placed a great deal of confidence in him, asking him to assist in sensitive matters.

For reasons that are not altogether clear, Elizabeth seems to have lost much of her Christian faith in the years that followed, although she strongly denied being an “infidel.” Commenting on revival meetings taking place in Gorham in 1885, Elizabeth regretted her religious situation. “I try as hard as any one but as to get the feeling … it is impossible.

For example, as late as 1847 Bates held to the standard Millerite view that the saints would inhabit a renewed earth during the millennium. In contrast, there were indications already in Ellen White's first vision in 1844 that the redeemed would spend the 1,000 years in heaven. Likewise, for a time Bates was convinced that the revolutionary upheavals sweeping through Europe in 1848 were the beginnings of the “time of trouble, such as never was,” foretold in Daniel 12:1, while about the same time Ellen White was shown in vision that “the time of trouble, such as never was, had not yet commenced.”"},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 789.7","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

In 1873 the Belden children were taken from Charlotte. “Charlotte is raving over the children's going to Potterville,” Ellen White wrote in her diary, adding that she “felt sad and cried … [at] the sad state of that family.” Apparently by 1877 Charlotte Belden was a patient at the Michigan Asylum for the Insane in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Writing from California, Ellen requested that “someone [go] to Kalamazoo and see if Charlotte Belden is there and her condition.” A letter from Stephen Belden in 1879 tells of Charlotte's attempts to leave the asylum.

For Daniel Bourdeau the turning point came in December 1872 with the publication of Testimony for the Church, No. 22, in which Ellen White called for greater efforts to reach foreign language groups and specifically chided the Bourdeau brothers for their poor response to the need for French books and tracts. Publicly acknowledging these “reproofs and instructions” in a letter to the Review, Daniel Bourdeau immediately set about writing and translating, and a few months later, in September 1873, embarked on a challenging mission to reach French-speaking communities in Wisconsin and Illinois. In 1875 Ellen White affirmed his pioneering efforts: “Brother Bourdeau stood nobly amid opposition such as our brethren have no knowledge of.” With this encouragement, Daniel Bourdeau's course was set. For the remainder of his life his focus was on evangelism among French-speaking populations in Europe, Canada, and the United States. There were gaps when, for a while, he worked mainly with English speakers, but, as he put it, at such times he felt “like a fish out of water.”"},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 795.3","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

She also had high regard for Marion, who often traveled with Daniel and supported him in his work. “Sister Bourdeau has been a laborer of no little influence … a treasure of greater value than finest gold,” Ellen exclaimed in 1875 after learning of Marion's work with Daniel in Illinois and Wisconsin. “Would to God,” she continued, “we had one hundred women consecrated to the work, going forth as missionaries.”"},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 795.4","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

T. Jones and E. J. Waggoner. Butler (and many with him) insisted that their interpretation of the “law” in Galatians 3:24 and their focus on righteousness through Christ gave aid to critics of the Sabbath and undermined traditional Adventist respect for the ten-commandment law. Using the leverage of his presidential office, Butler sought to oppose the “new” teachings and to enlist Ellen White's support. When her backing did not materialize and she openly supported Jones and Waggoner at the 1888 Minneapolis General Conference session, Butler, broken in health, promptly resigned his office. He spent the next 13 years in retirement running a fruit farm in Bowling Green, Florida, and nursing Lentha, who had become partially paralyzed following a stroke about 1891. Following her death in 1901, Butler was quickly coopted for the presidency of the Florida Conference (1901-1904) and the Southern Union Conference (1902-1907). His second marriage, in 1907, was to a widow, Elizabeth Jane Grainger (née Work), earlier a teacher at Healdsburg College and missionary to Japan, together with her husband, W. C. Grainger."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 802.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G. White Letters and Manuscripts: Volume 1, p. 802.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"“I never had more unbounded faith in the Testimonies than now,” Butler exclaimed in 1882. Earlier, in the mid-1870s, as president of the Iowa Conference, he had vigorously supported the visions against the attacks of the Marion Party. Even when Butler himself became the object of censure in a testimony, he was open to accept it. Thus, when in 1875 he received a testimony that he interpreted as a call for his resignation as General Conference president, Butler reacted with alacrity: “My mind was settled before the reading of the testimony was finished. I resigned at once.” The testimonies he received during the theological crises of 1886-1888, however, were a much more severe test for Butler. For a time, in 1888, Ellen White even classed him with those “who appear to be defenders of the Testimonies, but are their real assailants.” Finding himself unsupported and even opposed by Ellen White on the issues of the law in Galatians and the new focus on righteousness in Christ, Butler refused to budge. In response to an 1888 letter from Ellen White pointing out his part in the Galatians dispute, Butler retorted, “I have not, Sister White, been able to see the justice of your letter of April 5, 1887, and never expect to.” Not until five years later did Butler begin to admit that he may have been on the wrong side on some of those issues. For Lentha, it was an even longer struggle. “My poor wife,” Butler wrote in 1904, “never could get her feelings fully brought around until just a little while before her death.” Looking back over his life experiences in 1906, Butler remarked to J. H. Kellogg, “I have had Testimonies, I tell you, that shaved [me] to the very quick … and it takes a lot of study before you can really come to the point of cheerfully accepting them.” Unlike Kellogg, however, Butler retained his confidence in the testimonies of Ellen White, declaring in his old age, in 1907, “I do not suppose there is anyone who believes them any more strongly than I do.”"},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 802.2","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

At age 19 Roswell moved with his family to western New York, where he remained most of his life. About 1835 he married Catherine M. Harvey at Mill Grove, New York, and for 10 years taught in public schools in the area. Cottrell was rather ambivalent to the Second Advent preaching of the Millerites. Although personally sympathetic to much of their teaching, he could not join a movement that showed very little interest in even investigating the claims of Sabbatarians. Cottrell's dilemma was resolved when he subsequently came into contact with the Sabbatarian Adventist movement. “After some nine months [of] careful and cautious examination,” he “arrived at the decision” and joined the new movement in 1851, together with his family."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 814.2","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

As a writer, it was … superlative.” According to one estimate, Cottrell contributed 1,692 items to the Review, ranging from theological analysis to exhortation to poetry. In 1864 the New York and northern Pennsylvania Conference voted, in view of “the labors of Bro. R. F. Cottrell in writing for the Review,” to pay his salary “the same as though he were engaged in preaching.” Of his theological contributions he is remembered most for his involvement in the debate over church organization in the early 1860s. However, the Seventh-day Adventist Encyclopedia cites Cottrell as an important contributor to Seventh-day Adventist theological development in a wide number of areas (see, e.g., articles entitled “Covenant,” “Death,” “Humanity, Doctrine of,” “Probation,” “Religious Liberty,” “Sin”).

By the summer of 1858 he was appointed to preach among the French-speaking groups in northern New York that he had previously worked with as a Baptist preacher. James White appealed for donations from Review readers to help the poverty-stricken Czechowski family pay off a mortgage and get settled."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 819.3","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Aiming to start a city mission in New York, Czechowski rented property, ran up high bills, and then appealed for donations through the Review to cover the costs. When in addition it became apparent after about a year that his city mission was yielding scant results, church leaders, while never doubting Czechowski's zeal and ardor, began to question his financial management capabilities and general trustworthiness. Thus when by the early 1860s he began seriously petitioning church leadership to sponsor him to start a mission in Europe, there were doubts on all sides. As J. N. Andrews explained some years later: “We thought him not at that time prepared for so responsible an undertaking. We therefore requested him to wait. … We did not think him a prudent manager.” In a similar vein, Ellen White appealed to Czechowski in 1861: “Hold yourself ready to follow the opening providence of God, but you should not mark out a course for yourself.”"},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 819.4","refcode_long":"The Ellen G. White Letters and Manuscripts: Volume 1, p. 819.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"As it turned out, Czechowski was not willing to wait or take counsel, and with his relations with Battle Creek strained he ultimately turned to non-Sabbatarian Adventists (in particular the Advent Christians) for financial aid to pursue his European plans. It was a dubious tactic, since Czechowski did not make it clear to the Advent Christians that he was still an earnest Seventh-day Adventist, whereas they assumed that his break with Battle Creek was also a doctrinal one. The tactic backfired within a few years of his arrival in Italy in 1864. By 1869 The World's Crisis, main organ of the Advent Christians, warned its readers that Czechowski “has been receiving our contributions to raise up a company of Jewish Sabbathkeepers.” Donations soon dried up, and since no funds were forthcoming from Battle Creek either, Czechowski's mission experienced severe financial difficulties during its final years before his death in 1876 in Vienna. Nevertheless his years in Europe produced some very solid results on which J. N. Andrews was able to build when he arrived in Switzerland in 1874 as the first “official” Seventh-day Adventist missionary to Europe. Writing in 1870 with a tinge of regret, James White saw the hand of Providence in it all: “While we acknowledge the hand of God in this, we feel humbled … that in consequence of our fears to trust money with Bro. Czechowski, and our lack of care to patiently counsel him as to its proper use, God used our most decided opponents to carry forward the work.”"},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 820.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Thus, in 1860, while James White was away from home, Ellen and her children stayed a week with the Glovers, who had now moved to Newton, near Battle Creek, Michigan. “They took great pains to make us happy,” Ellen observed. Later, in 1873, when the family had moved again to Kansas, Charles Glover happened to meet the Whites in Colorado while he was there on business and ended up spending several weeks with them at their borrowed mountain retreat.

Like his mentor, Joseph Bates, Gurney was cautious about accepting their authenticity. “I wished to prove all things,” he relates, and subsequently traveled to the Harmon home in Portland, Maine, to make enquiries, visited “a number of weeks with the [Harmon] family and in their vicinity and became convinced that … God had called sister [sic] Harmon to an important work.” Acting on his conviction before returning to Massachusetts, Gurney shared the cost with James White of republishing Ellen Harmon's earliest visions in April 1846 in the broadside To the Little Remnant Scattered Abroad. After this he continued, “I often met sister [sic] Harmon. … I have seen her in holy vision often. I have been encouraged by the visions, and sharply reproved by them [see Ms 11, 1850 (Dec. 25)]. … I never have doubted their inspiration.”"},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 837.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

The factory was rebuilt and enlarged, but again it burned to the ground, with a loss of $249,000. Insurance covered only a fraction of the losses. The warnings and ensuing disasters may explain why George Lay subsequently returned to the church.

Several poems and letters to the editor from Henry Nichols were published in the Review during the early 1850s in addition to subscription receipts, etc. Little is heard, however, of Henry Nichols, after 1855. The reason, Ellen White explained in 1862, was that “doubts and difficulties [were] thrown into Henry Nichols’ mind, which have destroyed his interest and faith in the visions and in us.” Ironically, she maintained that it was J. N. Andrews, later a strong supporter of the visions, a General Conference president, and first official Seventh-day Adventist missionary to Europe, who instilled the doubts into Henry Nichols’ mind “at the time of the removal of the Office,” i.e., in 1855 when the Review office was moved from Rochester, New York, to Battle Creek, Michigan. (J. N. Andrews, under influence from his family, had doubts about the authenticity of the visions for a period of time during the 1850s.) Writing in 1903 to Henry Nichols, Ellen White made it fairly clear that Nichols subsequently abandoned Sabbathkeeping for many years, but began to keep it again in his old age, shortly before 1903.

Mrs. Palmer vigorously denied the charges, and the Jackson group became bitterly divided between her accusers and defenders. During this state of affairs Ellen White received a vision reproving Abigail Palmer's unchristian spirit but revealing that she had not, in fact, used the offensive term, and reprimanding those who had harshly condemned her.

Among other responsibilities, he served on a committee set up in 1852 to raise funds for the first Review printing press and to oversee “the financial concerns of the paper.” In 1860 Poole was active in the debate at a general conference in Battle Creek over the adoption of “Seventh-day Adventist” as the denominational name.

At a conference in 1853 at New Haven, Vermont, “all were agreed in expressing their disapproval” of Ezra Eastman and J. R. Towle. “While they travel from place to place (doing no real good, but, rather, harm), apparently to get their living, they are unworthy the confidence of the people of God.” A vision given Ellen White some weeks later confirmed this appraisal. Towle did not break his association with the Sabbatarian movement after this setback, however. For six years the Review carried a continuing record of his subscriptions, donations, and letters (including a letter of “confession” in 1856) until 1859, after which there is no further record of him.

Waggoner was born in Pennsylvania and married Maryetta Hall in 1845. Among their 10 children was Ellet J. Waggoner, who, with A. T. Jones, was prominent in the 1888 righteousness by faith revival. At the time of their conversion to Sabbatarian Adventism in the winter of 1851-1852, Waggoner was editor of the newspaper Sauk County Democrat in Baraboo, Wisconsin. Within a few months he began to propagate his new faith. Too poor to afford transportation, Waggoner often undertook his early evangelistic journeys on foot. “Brn. Phelps and Waggoner,” James White reported in 1854, “have traveled many hundred miles on foot to get the truth before the people.” After 1855 his preaching itineraries took him to various Midwestern states, and later, in the mid-1870s, to California. Waggoner was also a lucid and prodigious writer, publishing several hundred articles and a number of theological books, including The Nature and Tendency of Modern Spiritualism (1857), The Atonement (1884), and From Eden to Eden (1890). After James White's death he also composed the (anonymous) “Appendix” to Life Sketches … of Elder James White, and His Wife, Mrs. Ellen G.

From 1879 to 1886 he edited the West Coast paper Signs of the Times, first as “resident editor” and from 1881 as editor in chief. In 1885 his zeal for health reform resulted in the publication of the Pacific Health Journal, of which he was both founder and editor. During the same year Waggoner was largely instrumental in founding and editing the American Sentinel, devoted to issues of religious liberty.

Much of the responsibility for the discord, especially during the early years of their married life, Ellen White placed on Maryetta. Of Joseph she wrote in 1860, “You have tried every means in your power to remove every cause of fretfulness from your wife … but in vain. … The influence of her continual fretfulness and finding fault is ruinous to your children.” Among other things Ellen counseled Joseph to “decidedly rule your own house.” Although Maryetta publicly confessed her wrongs in the columns of the Review in 1861, she appears not to have changed her ways, and by the late 1860s was involved in an adulterous affair.

Although later maintaining that adultery was never involved, Waggoner embarked on an affair with a local church member, Mrs. Mary Charlotte (“Lottie”) Chittenden, that continued for several years. By 1882 Ellen White was aware of the situation, but rather than recommending Waggoner's termination, she sent him several warnings and appeals to break off the relationship. Unfortunately his promises to do so were not fulfilled, and by 1885 the situation had reached crisis proportions. Under pressure from both G. I. Butler, General Conference president, and Ellen White, Waggoner finally left Oakland and Mary Chittenden in mid-1886 and returned to his wife and home in Burlington, Michigan, where he stayed for almost a year in a limbo state, his future undecided. George Butler remained unconvinced of the sincerity of Joseph Waggoner's confessions and felt the church should “purge the camp” of Waggoner and others of his ilk. While she was also anxious about the depth of Waggoner's repentance, in April 1887 Ellen White urged that mercy be introduced into the equation. “If we err, let it be on the side of mercy rather than on the side of condemnation and harsh dealing.” Butler yielded to Ellen White's position, and shortly thereafter Waggoner left for Europe to serve as editor for what was to be the final two years of his life."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 901.4","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Also in 1861 Frederick and Lydia Wheeler received a testimony of reproof from Ellen White, focusing on their hypercritical attitude toward fellow church member and neighbor Ira Abbey, while failing to notice more serious problems in their own family. For a year or so Frederick Wheeler refused to acknowledge the rebuke and began to spread his doubts about the visions to others.

He was also a successful author and educator. Born in Rocky Hill, Connecticut, he spent his early years in Battle Creek, Michigan. Eager for further education, Edson (he was known by his middle name) studied commercial subjects and took medical courses in New Jersey and at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, during his late teens and early 20s. At various times during this period he worked at the Review and Herald press in Battle Creek, learning the printing trade.

Starting as a bookkeeper, he later became one of the directors. His five-year tenure at the press, however, was not a great success. His tendency toward unrealistic business expansion on borrowed money led to several financial crises for the press and to his termination in 1879 or early 1880. However, Edson White's years in California were not without their successes. His musical and printing talents combined in the compilation of two Adventist hymnals in 1878—Hymns of Praise for Use at Lectures and Revival Meetings and Song Anchor: A Choice Collection of Favorites for Sabbath School and Praise Service. Emma helped with some of the typesetting of the music. This beginning led to Edson's compiling of five further hymnals. While in California he also worked actively for the improvement and organization of Sabbath schools. In 1877 he was elected superintendent of the California State Sabbath School Society, the first such state society. Later, during the 1880s, he served several years on the executive committee of the General (International) Sabbath School Association in Battle Creek."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 905.4","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Toward the end of this period he went through a spiritual decline, finally declaring himself “not at all religiously inclined” in a letter to his mother in the summer of 1893. Shortly thereafter, however, Edson experienced reconversion, sold his business, and from 1895 to 1899 led an innovative mission to Mississippi, focusing on the African-American population. He established literacy classes (some taught by Emma) and schools, creating the goodwill that opened the way for churches to be established. Much of the financing for the initial venture came from the sale of The Gospel Primer, a book of Bible stories Edson wrote in 1894 that doubled as a reading primer for the schools and literacy classes. It was the first of several similar children's books White wrote during the next decade or so in order to help fund the Southern work. Some titles, such as Best Stories From the Best Book and The Gospel Primer, sold by the hundreds of thousands. He also authored major books for adults, such as The Coming King, which had similar sales and were translated into other languages."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 906.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Modern scholarship has not supported the contention of D. M. Canright, early critic of Seventh-day Adventism, that James dominated the marriage. However, the last years of their marriage were complicated by the effects of several strokes that James suffered, beginning in 1865. Although he was repeatedly able to recover mentally from the strokes and continue to provide effective church leadership, on the emotional level James at times became depressed, irritable, and hypercritical, something that negatively impacted his relationship with coworkers as well as with Ellen. “I can but dread … James's changeable moods, his strong feelings, his censures,” Ellen confided to her close friend Lucinda Hall in 1876."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 907.2","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

His negative moods also made it difficult for Ellen to write in peace or to meet speaking appointments, and at times she agonized over whether or not it was her duty to work apart from James for a period to carry out her felt duties to the church. Ellen's absences from James in 1874 (two months), 1876 (two months), 1878 (three to four months) and 1880 (five months) were at least in part because of such concerns.

By 1859, however, even John had made his decision, and Ellen happily reported that “Father and Mother White” “have embraced the Sabbath and are coming right along into all the present truth.” Even after this date, however, John White retained his membership with the Christian Connection church, as he had for the previous 40 years or so."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 908.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Their thinking of marriage might have been injudicious; further than this they were not guilty, and the treatment of Mary was cruel in the extreme.” The marriage went ahead a year or two later, and both of their sons became lifelong church workers."},{"refcode_short":"1EGWLM 911.5","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

In the United States during the mid-nineteenth century animal magnetism was a popular philosophy of healing. Originated by Viennese physician Franz Anton Mesmer (1734-1815), it taught that an invisible magnetic fluid permeates the universe. Mesmer theorized that disease produced an imbalance of this fluid within the human body, which could be cured through the use of magnets and electrical current. He eventually abandoned the use of magnets and proposed that the “healer's body,” “permeated with animal magnetism, could redirect the patient's magnetic fluid without the use of magnets.” The goal was to induce a “crisis” by altering the subject's mental state through fever, delirium, convulsions, uncontrolled weeping, and nervous twitches. Mesmer saw these manifestations as healthy symptoms of healing. Suggestibility and dominance were used to produce a trance and thus realign the body.45 Irving Kirsch et al., “Introduction to Clinical Hypnosis,” in Handbook of Clinical Hypnosis, p. 5; John C. Burnham, “Franz Anton Mesmer,” International Encyclopedia of Psychiatry, Psychology, Psychoanalysis, and Neurology, vol. 7, p. 213.

The American Revolution produced a tremendous optimism combined with a spirit of freedom and independence. As Americans pushed west, a frontier disposition became increasingly dominant. The aristocratic Federalist Party began to fall into disfavor, while the popular ideas of freedom and individuality promoted by Thomas Jefferson were embraced. At the same time the older authoritarian state-sponsored Congregational and Presbyterian churches were seen to be out of harmony with the new American freedom and the needs of the common people.

The key identifiable theological orientations of fanatics included spiritualizing, extreme literalizing, extreme sanctification, and mesmerism. She was opposed by the fanatics themselves as well as by the broader Adventist leaders for associating with those of a fanatical disposition. Her reason for interacting with fanatics was her concern to help those who were within her sphere of influence who still had confidence that something of prophetic significance had happened in October 1844.
