Each is to maintain its own individuality, and the workers are to receive help from the institutions that have the largest revenue.

We are doing our best to lead the people to look upon the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world. In every discourse we seek to trace the effects of the manifold wisdom of God as brought home to the soul in the development of individual character.

In every church there will be those who desire to be leaders, and if the leadership is not given to them, they will think that there is no use of attending meetings. They will not consider that there may be something which they can learn from somebody else, and that they can be benefited by listening to the teachings of others. They will not acknowledge that by hearing the truth from other lips, they may be enabled to form a more symmetrical Christian character. They cherish a burning desire to educate others, to preach to others, and yet they need to learn that before they can be qualified to be acceptable teachers, they must themselves become teachable. The very best kind of help that they could give the church would be to manifest a spirit of meekness, revealing the fact that they are in need of help."},{"refcode_short":"10LtMs, Lt 88, 1895, par. 15","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 10 (1895), Lt 88, 1895, par. 15","content":"Individually, we can help the church by following the instruction of Paul.

I entreat of you to work in such a way as to build up one another. Do not let variance come in, but work in harmony in glorifying God. The Lord desires that you give yourselves wholly to Him. When you are discouraged, go to Him, and pray to Him. Do not hide your talents by burying them in worldly enterprises. The day of the Lord is fast hastening, and the exhortation to us is, “Work while the day lasts; for lo, the night cometh, in which no man can work.” [See John 9:4.] Precious time is being wasted, and the money which belongs to God is kept from his treasury by binding it up in worldly enterprises."},{"refcode_short":"10LtMs, Lt 90, 1895, par. 22","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 10 (1895), Lt 90, 1895, par. 22","content":"The end of all things is at hand, and God calls for men to come into active service and do their duty because He desires it, and the world needs their help.

How is it that so many could be so blind as not to see the necessities of their sister-workers?

The higher priced lands we were unable to touch because there was not money in our hands to invest in large-priced lands, and the small sum paid for this land, made it possible to secure a large tract which would give work to the very men and students who needed work. He decided that there were rare facilities in some things connected with this land that the many other lands they had inspected did not give. This was a great relief to me.

One prohibition was made in showing the sovereignty of their Creator and His authority. One tree was reserved as a test. In this single fruit tree, which was forbidden for the holy pair to eat, was the lesson to Adam and Eve of their dependence upon God. This reserved fruit was the symbol of their dependence. “Thou shalt not eat of this forbidden tree, lest ye die.” Whenever they looked at that tree, they were reminded of God’s authority. “Of all the fruit of the trees of the garden ye may freely eat.” [Genesis 2:16, 17.] But of the fruit of the forbidden tree they should not eat lest they die. The smallness of the test made the sin more inexcusable. They had no need to eat of that tree at all. The sorrow and woe and death was brought into the world because of the sin of disobeying a plain “Thus saith the Lord.” They could not see, under the presentation of Satan, why they could not eat of that tree as well as of all the fruit of the other trees. But this was a test of their acknowledgement of the sovereignty of God. All sin is the transgression of the will of God and man substituting his own will as if independent of a higher claim.

If he has been dishonest, he must repent of it. And he should teach his children the way of the Lord. Christ prayed not that his disciples should be taken out of the world, but that they should be kept from the evil. Do not talk darkness. Talk of him who hath called us out of the darkness into his marvelous light. Tell me how much you have contemplated that marvelous love. What effect has it had on your life?

And another said, I have bought me five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: and I pray thee have me excused.

Those who refuse to come to the gospel feast show the relation in which they stand to God by the fruit they bear, in their spirit, words and actions. The invitation to the gospel feast had been presented to the scribes and Pharisees as well as to Christ’s disciples; but the spirituality of the law of God had not been discerned by them, and they with one consent began to make excuse. Though they were very punctilious in carrying on their forms and ceremonies, yet they had little knowledge of the holy, benevolent, paternal character of God. They did not discern the relation of responsibility in which they stood to God and to one another. They had no place in their hearts for a true conception of what constitutes the kingdom of God, and did not understand the grace of God in giving his Son for the salvation of the human family.

They did not appreciate the fact that Christ is the bread that cometh down from heaven, that from him flows the streams of salvation. His inexpressible love had furnished the costly banquet, and had provided unsearchable, inexhaustible resources. To be invited to the supper was the greatest honor that could be conferred, and the universe of heaven looked with amazement and astonishment upon those who refused the gospel feast. The angels listened with grief to the excuses that were offered as a reason for not coming to the banquet that had been prepared at an infinite cost. Can we measure the love that has provided for us the plan of salvation? When we can make a chain long enough to reach into the depths of the pit of sin into which man has fallen, then we can know the depth of the love, the cost of the redemption, that has been provided for us through the death of Christ. Nothing but the love of God could provide so expensive a feast as the gospel feast. The provision is nothing less than Christ himself. He says, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.

And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me cannot be my disciple.” [Luke 14:26, 27.] The apostle Paul said, “God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.” [Galatians 6:14.] There is of necessity an experience like unto crucifixion in the life of the believer. He has lived in harmony with the ways and customs of the world, he has been united with those who enjoy the pleasures of the world, and who were one with him in seeking for that which would gratify pride and ambition. He had been in harmony with the disobedient, and with those who made excuses for living in sin, and has been one of the confederacy who have clung to one another in disobedience, and sustained and strengthened one another in unrighteousness.

In this parable the Lord represented before the haughty Jews the fact that he would send the gospel to those whom they had despised, from whom in their self-righteousness, they had drawn away their garments, passing them by as if they were lepers to be shunned. Jesus represented this class as the very ones who would accept the invitation which the former class had despised and rejected. To accept the invitation to the supper meant to give up the worldly interests that had absorbed their minds, and turn their attention to preparation for the feast. The gospel message presented the fact that God required the whole man, and desired the service of heart, intellect and strength. The believer is to become like the branch that is grafted into a living vine, that knits fibre by fibre, vein by vein, and draws all its vital nourishment from the vine, giving evidence that its life is drawn from the vine by the character of the fruit that it bears. So is the Christian to draw his life from the life of Christ, and to develop a character after the divine similitude. Abiding in the warmth and light of the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness, as the branch in the living vine, the Christian is to bear the fruits of the Spirit, manifesting the divine virtues of his Lord and Master. The attributes of the character of Christ are to be revealed in his character to the glory of God; the good works wrought by those who are eating of the bread of heaven, who are partakers of the divine nature, announce to the world that they have accepted the invitation to the gospel feast. Christ says, “If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love.” [John 15:10.] Those who abide in Christ, constantly reveal the fact that they have a healthful experience as the result of spiritual union with Christ.

The lawyer came to Christ and asked, “Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?” This was a pointed, definite question, and Jesus answered him by referring him to the law of God. He said, “What is written in the law? how readest thou? And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbor as thyself. And he said unto him, Thou has answered right: this do and thou shalt live. But he willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor?” [Luke 10:25-29.] Then Jesus gave him a lesson that revealed to him the fact that every needy soul is our neighbor. To accept the gospel message means to love God with all the heart and our neighbors as ourselves. Jesus cannot accept a divided heart. The heart that is absolved in and controlled by earthly affections, cannot be given up to God. No adequate excuse can be framed for refusing to love God supremely, and our neighbors as ourselves. This comprehends the whole duty of man. The Lord Jesus who has paid the ransom price for humanity, demands a willing service from his purchased possession. “Ye are not your own,” “ye are bought with a price,” even with the precious blood of the Son of God. [1 Corinthians 6:19, 20.] The new life that comes to the soul through conversion, comes through communion with God, and produces God-likeness in the character. Love, peace, joy, faith, gratitude and hope spring up in the renewed soul. “If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, (to the love of the world, and to self-serving,) and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.

Sin only is a hateful thing in the sight of God, and while the Lord hates the sin, he loves the sinner, and has manifested this by giving Christ for the sins of the world. “For God so loved the world, (not their sins and transgressions,) that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” [John 3:16.] But he that would follow after Christ, must not let the influence of his affection for father, mother, son, or daughter, or any other friend or relative lead him into disobedience. He who yields his loyalty to God because of his affection for his relatives, shows that he does not love God supremely, and refuses to accept the condition of salvation. There are parents who are opposed to God, and who are determined that their children shall not obey God’s requirements. The commandments of the Lord enjoin upon children obedience to their parents up to a certain limit. But when parents seek to come between God and their children, when obedience to their parents means transgression of the law of God, then children are to obey God, who is our heavenly Father, him from whom all blessings flow. When children are placed in so disagreeable a position as this, they must go forward humbly, prayerfully, but be as firm as a rock to principle. If called upon to endure punishment, let them meekly submit to the pain. Children are to respect their parents in everything where they can do so conscientiously; but a child of God cannot respect parents in acts of transgression. The apostle says, “Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.” [Ephesians 6:1.] Children can obey their parents in the Lord, for then they will not be called upon to violate the commandments of God. Let children obey their parents in every command that is right, but let parents and children both remember that God is the Father and the Owner of us all. If parents should ask their children to swear falsely, to steal, to bear false witness, to break the Sabbath, or to violate any other one of the ten commandments, they are not to obey. God has the first claim upon them. He is the heavenly Parent, the Creator and Redeemer of the whole human family.

Such a child or youth is placed where he needs help every moment in order that he may move wisely in the fear of God, and neither dishonor God nor disobey his parents. Satan will sometimes cause the father or the mother to think that their child belongs to them, both soul and body. They act as though they were sole proprietors of the child; but their children are the property of God, both by creation and by redemption. Under the inspiration of Satan, a wicked father or mother may do very strange things, and work enormous iniquity in seeking to compel the child to dishonor God. This is not a rare thing. But the child is in God’s world, eating the bounties that God’s providence has supplied, and his first duty is to honor God.
