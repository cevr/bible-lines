I am unable to write you a long letter; but I will say if you take this step, you depart from the plainest injunctions of God’s Word and cannot expect or claim His blessing upon such a union. All the promises of God are on condition of obedience to Him. He keepeth truth forever, and there is no unfaithfulness in Him. We feel ourselves happy if we have the assurance of benefits received from finite beings upon whom we feel we can rely. In our faith we dismiss our cares and our anxieties in the perfect hope that our confidence will be fully justified, but what security should the believer feel who has the written Word of a holy God? His promise is verity and truth; upon His Word he may stay his soul and rest calmly and securely if he complies with the conditions upon which the promise is made. Have you taken God’s Word as your counselor? Have you listened to His voice of wisdom? I know the heart is wayward, wilful, perverse in its promptings. Influences are not wanting to sway the soul in the direction of selfish desires. Satan stands ready to infatuate the mind and soul to pursue a course directly contrary to God’s expressed will, that he may separate that soul from God, and he interposes his temptations and gains control over the mind and the heart’s affections. This is Satan’s studied plan to lead souls to turn from One mighty in counsel to the persuasion of minds who have no love for God, no love for the truth."},{"refcode_short":"5LtMs, Lt 1, 1887, par. 2","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 5 (1887-1888), Lt 1, 1887, par. 2","content":"God has blessed you with great light, and the Lord expects of you to study His will, to carefully follow the directions given you in His Word.

Always questioning and giving birth to doubts by expression binds the soul in the chains of unbelief. That evidence God gives to all His children is sufficient to encourage faith and strengthen confidence, but talking unbelief strengthens unbelief and the conversation is not of faith but of unbelief. The natural consequence is, there is a harvest of unbelief to be reaped. The confidence in God is broken up and cast away, which if retained would produce a recompense of reward. Then when adversity comes, when suffering and distress and anguish, as it will to every soul, the shield of faith has been cast away, and how shall he quench the fiery darts of the wicked one?

While God grants you your reasoning powers, subdue yourself through the grace given you of God, keep pride of dress under control, keep unbelief apart from your life, for unbelief has been cherished until it has become a part of your abiding character. You talk it as naturally as a stream flows down the hill, and sow the seeds of your doubts and skepticism, and know it not. You have children that will bear the traits of character you have given them of unbelief. No one can tell what terrible struggles it costs the soul that has thrown away the shield of faith and opened the door to the enemy to expel him and gain the solid foundation again for their feet. Then remember the atmosphere that surrounds your soul affects your children. Your words impress their minds, and the seeds you sow are taking root in their hearts. There will be hard battles for you both to fight, but you both may obtain the victory even under discouraging circumstances; unbelief may be overcome by cultivating faith. If poor short-sighted mortals follow their own will and their own way rather than God’s will and God’s way, they will have a hard time; but if they will see their need of the guidance of the Spirit of God and return unto the Lord, He will not break the bruised reed, He will not quench the smoking flax. Oh, my dear sister, God is very good, He is merciful, He is of tender compassion, and now if you will place yourself wholly on the Lord’s side, and seek with all your powers to break this delusive snare of unbelief which holds you like a chain of steel, you will obtain the victory. You should now seek constantly, determinedly to exercise faith, talk faith, and throw around your children an atmosphere which will encourage faith, strange and unnatural as this may be to you. Jennie, do it, I pray you.

I have been shown that the Lord had an experience for you both to obtain, and that this experience in bearing responsibilities would be more readily gained by Sister Maxson than by her husband. Brother Maxson takes things too easy. He does not take the burden upon his soul. Does not study his patients and feel their needs and their wants as is necessary, and as he should. He is too superficial. He needs to carry the weight of the cases of the patients. He needs to study more deeply and to look to God for wisdom to aid him in making such a physician as God can pronounce his work, “Well done.” [Matthew 25:21.] He lacks thoroughness and efficiency in his work, because he does not love close, taxing effort. Dr. Maxson is not now what he might be in the medical profession, with the opportunities and advantages he has already had. He has framed an excuse for this, because Dr. Kellogg has not advanced him. But he should not make this an excuse. If he were thoroughly intent to make a first-class practitioner, he could have made progress; but he has been willing to meet a low standard, he not considering that the fault was in himself, but charged to circumstances. But the reasons lie mainly in himself. If he had put to the highest stretch his powers to be a first-class physician, he would have been recognized as such, in spite of every untoward circumstance that has hindered him. He has desired to grasp the higher rounds of the ladder, to do the most responsible work, when he has not qualified himself by study, by close, hard climbing, to gain this experience. He has not had real love for the taxations that are attendant upon a physician’s life. He will never be able to stand equal to Dr. Kellogg, as a practitioner, and there are very few men in our world who can do the nice, critical work that Dr. Kellogg does, with equal success."},{"refcode_short":"5LtMs, Lt 7, 1887, par. 4","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 5 (1887-1888), Lt 7, 1887, par. 4","content":"The letters I have written in regard to a physician's duty, his capabilities, and his power to do a wonderful work for the Master were meant for you both.

I have naught to say in regard to Dr. Kellogg's neglect to trust you with responsibilities of a critical character. But I think he has seen this very want in your habits of study. Your want of care-taking was so marked that he has feared to put responsibilities upon you, fearing the result, if mistakes were made, would hurt you and him more.

I was sure you would not make a success in the missionary work; for you would not bring that energy into the work, that thoroughness that would insure success. The work of God in winning souls requires a great outlay of positive power. The worker, in season, out of season, may confuse the plans of the adversary. Satan is a diligent, persevering, artful enemy that we have to contend against, and sinners cannot be taken out of his ranks without determined, persevering effort. It is not enough to be content to exert no really deleterious influence, but there must be a positive influence to save souls. There must be a strong, decided influence holding forth the Word of life. Not to wait until we are importuned for counsel and help, but labor earnestly for souls as they that must give an account. We are to show by the luster of our piety, by our earnest zeal, by the energy of our godly example, and the earnest prayers and entreaties, that the truth is to us a living reality. Not to do this, and do it habitually and perseveringly, is to be guilty of neglect of souls, neglect of doing our appointed work. You are, neither of you, to live to please yourselves. God will accept nothing of you or me but a thorough consecration, unreserved surrender of ourselves to His service, as pattern Christians. We know not how we are being read by others. We are not always on our guard. Our only security against failures, that we shall not be false guides, and do infinite harm to souls, is to be in constant communion with God, having that unreserved piety which is a shining light constantly. If connected with the Source of light, we all shall unconsciously reflect this Christian light, so that others will be benefited by its beams. We must not be in that position that we are consumers, and not producers, and never attain to that efficiency and consistent activity that we win no souls to Christ and strengthen no believers.

We must show no negligence, murmur at no demands of the Lord upon us. May the Lord impress your hearts and give you a deep experience in the things of God. Aim high, cultivate the powers entrusted to you, execute whatever you do with a strong hand. Cultivate the habit of not thinking you can do a great work, but in doing your very best in what you do undertake, whether you consider it important or not. Put your highest powers into requisition. Summon to your aid the strongest impulses which that immediate work you have in hand is entitled to enlist in its favor.

All this must be cleansed from the soul temple, and then God will work in much greater power for His people. But He cannot do this where those evil things exist; for should God bless, each party would be confirmed in his conviction that he was right and his brother wrong.

They are then exercised by another spirit than that of meekness and love. They think due respect is not paid to them, self-glory they do not receive. They begin to envy and be jealous; then they begin to demerit the one whom they envy. If they can make it appear that he is at fault in anything, it is magnified, and they seek to injure his reputation.

It is something different to be led into sin unawares, not intending to sin, but to sin through want of watchfulness and prayer, and not discerning the temptation of Satan and so falling into his snare, is very different from the one who plans and deliberately enters into temptation and plans out a course of sin, covering his sin skilfully that he shall not be detected. The treatment cannot be the same in both cases. More effective measures are needed to check the premeditated sin, but the apostle directs the treatment to be given to those who are overtaken or surprised or overcome by temptation. Ye which are spiritual, who have evidenced that you have a connection with God, let him restore such an one in the spirit of meekness, not crush all hope and courage out of the soul, but restore him in meekness, considering thyself lest thou also be tempted. Faith and reproofs will be needed, and kindly counsel and supplications to God, to bring them to see their danger and sin. The original word is, set in joint, as a dislocated bone; therefore the efforts should be made to set them in joint and bring them to themselves by convincing them of their sin and error, that they shall not be separated from the true Vine or, like a limb, cut off. They are to be loved because Christ loved us in our errors and in our weakness. There should be no triumphing in a brother’s fall.

And he exhorts, “Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.” “For if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.” [Verses 2, 3.] Many have altogether too high an opinion of their own ability. They are lifting up themselves, extolling self, while they censure and condemn their brethren, in the place of following the Bible rule in dealing with the erring. They feel sufficient to dictate, look upon themselves as wise and capable of great things, able to tell others what to do, full of confidence in their own ways and wisdom, when the genuine truth is they are not acquainted with themselves and do not know half what they should know or what they think they know. They are really elevating themselves. While such deceive others by exalting their requirements and their self-sufficiency, they deceive their own soul and will meet with the greatest loss themselves. They are not free from blunders or mistakes, and fall under temptations, while they self-confidently think themselves standing securely. The exhortation of the apostle, (Philippians 2:3-5): “Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves. Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.” If we expect compassion from Jesus Christ to ourselves, we must show the same to one another. If there is such a thing as mercy and compassion with the followers of Christ, if any sanctified, holy pity, then let it appear. The hardest heart, the most unpitying, must be moved by these words the apostle urges upon them. “Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.” [Verse 2.] I have been instrumental in bringing to you the gospel of Christ. You claim to be my children in the gospel, Then make my heart full of joy and comfort by living in love.

Christ has given us an example of love and humility and has enjoined upon His followers to love one another as He has loved us. We must in lowliness of mind esteem others better than ourselves. Be severe upon our own defects of character; be quick to discern our own errors and mistakes; and make less of the faults of others than of our own. We must feel a special interest in looking upon the things of others, not coveting them, not to find fault with them, not to remark upon them and present them in a false light; but to do strict justice in all things to our brethren and all with whom we have any dealings. A selfish spirit, laying out plans for our own selfish interest, grasping a little gain, or to labor to show a superiority or rivalry, is an offense to God.

They now bear altogether too much of the defective mold of your own peculiar hereditary and cultivated traits of character. I cannot specify all these things in all their minutiae; but I tell you they exist, and this should keep you on your guard, that you do not consider your way the only perfect way and your method the criterion for others to follow.

Is Satan with his suggestions making our minds and hearts a repository for his seeds of doubt and unbelief and infidelity? Paul says, “I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.” “And the God of peace will bruise Satan under your feet shortly.” [Romans 16:19, 20.] Paul exhorts his Corinthian brethren, “Now I beseech you brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment. For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.” [1 Corinthians 1:10, 11.] And then Paul gives directions accordingly."},{"refcode_short":"5LtMs, Lt 17, 1887, par. 10","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 5 (1887-1888), Lt 17, 1887, par. 10","content":"Now when a testimony from the Lord is borne to the erring, there is often a question asked: Who told ?

Now these evils were existing or they were not, but Paul had a work to do to counteract them. “Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.

Judged by a human standard he had abstained from sin, but when he looked into the depths of God’s law and saw himself as God saw him, he bowed in humiliation and confessed his guilt. He did not go away from the mirror and forget what manner of man he was, but he exercised genuine repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. He was washed, he was cleansed. He says, “I had not known sin except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. For I was alive without the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died.” [Romans 7:7-9.] Sin then appeared in its true hideousness, and his self-esteem was gone; he was humble. He no longer ascribed goodness and merit to himself. He ceased to think more highly of himself than he ought to think and ascribed all the glory to God. He was no longer sensitive to reproach, neglect, or contempt. He no longer sought earthly alliance, station, or honor. He did not pull others down to uplift himself. He became gentle, condescending, meek, and lowly of heart because he had learned his lesson in the school of Christ. He talked of Jesus and His matchless love, grew more and more into His matchless image. He bent his whole energy to win souls to Christ. When trial came upon him because of his unselfish love for souls, he bowed in prayer, and his love for them increased.

He might have been far advanced in practical knowledge so as to be a helper in the institution if he had gone forward and upward since his connection with the work. But I saw that the rebuke of God was upon him because he has not stood at his appointed place of duty until he was honorably released. When trouble arose, he should have gone directly to Brethren Fulton, Baker, and Loughborough and laid his case and all the circumstances connected with it before them and let them know the true situation. But instead of doing this he disconnected himself from the work, and some felt a sense of relief that he had done so; but I can see no other way than for Brother Rodgers to see his mistake and so far as possible correct it. He has been at fault in criticizing others, and he should confess this, humble himself before God, and take any position that he can fill to serve the cause of God, by devotion and faithfulness, endeavoring to redeem his failings of the past. If he has been falsely accused, he must take it as a Christian should and by his life prove the accusation to have been false. He must not feel that his dignity has been wounded and take himself away from his appointed work. If he had but stood faithfully at his place, he would have won precious victories, but he has need to humble himself as a little child before God and in no way dishonor his Redeemer."},{"refcode_short":"5LtMs, Lt 19, 1887, par. 17","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 5 (1887-1888), Lt 19, 1887, par. 17","content":"Brethren, God would work for us if He could do it safely. He wants to do great things for His people, but the strife of tongues has dishonored God, weakened the hands of His professed children, and brought dearth and feebleness into the church. Is it not time to arise, to open the heart and receive the rays of light that are shining forth from the living oracles? Is it not time that the love of God should be permitted to make its imprint upon the soul, that Jesus may be glorified among those who claim to be His followers? Brother Rodgers, if your brethren open the way, and you are willing to do what you can at the institution in the meekness of Christ, the Lord will accept the efforts that you put forth in His cause, but self must be hid in Jesus. The Lord wants every soul in the church at St. Helena and at Crystal Springs to obey His Word, to learn His will, to give heed to His requirements. There must be a decided change in the church. In place of gossip and censure there must be a spirit of sympathy, willingness, and desire to strengthen the hands that hang down, and to confirm the feeble knees. You are to be constantly seeking for precious pearls of truth; there must be a dying to the world. No cowardice nor compromise. There must be a seeking for that wisdom that is from above. The apostle asks, “Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? Let him show out of a good conversation his words with meekness of wisdom; but if ye have bitter envy and strife in your hearts, glory not and lie not against the truth. This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish, for where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work. But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.” [James 3:13-18.] May the Lord give you wisdom that you may heed the words I now present to you in the name of Jesus of Nazareth."},{"refcode_short":"5LtMs, Lt 20, 1887","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 5 (1887-1888), Lt 20, 1887","content":"Lt 20, 1887"},{"refcode_short":"5LtMs, Lt 20, 1887, par. 1","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 5 (1887-1888), Lt 20, 1887, par. 1","content":"I have been meaning to write to you for some days, but have been very sick with malaria.

She has been a woman who has seen much sorrow, and I know that God has worked for her. He has shown her favors, and she has had a genuine experience in the things of God; and the suspicions expressed by yourself and others in reference to her some time ago make me feel very sad, because I do not think she deserves them.

Everything that I can see is [that] the matter [is that] she may not [think], or you think she may not think, [that] everything her brethren in South Lancaster do is above criticism and not entering soul and spirit into every suggestion and plan has drawn upon her criticism and suspicion. I have great confidence in her for this, although she has made no complaints to me. Yet the words and the attitude of yourself toward her were, as well as others, to say the least, not cordial. If there is a woman that loves and fears God, in South Lancaster, it is Sister Harris. If there is a woman I would fear to slight, or offend, because it would grieve the Spirit of God, it is Sister Harris. And those who would speak against her in any way to affect your feelings toward her had better be on their knees before God, and get all that feeling out of their hearts, and not draw from her, but come close to her and show her sympathy and love. [Note: The next sentence is unclear, but it reads correctly according to the copy on file.] This changeable mood toward those who have been real pillars in the truth I cannot see is bearing the divine stamp; and if we have much less of this spirit to change, we should change our feelings, because some one does not think us above making mistakes in a spirit that is not of Christ, and I mean to condemn it wherever I see it."},{"refcode_short":"5LtMs, Lt 20, 1887, par. 17","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 5 (1887-1888), Lt 20, 1887, par. 17","content":"Well I must stop.

But there were hearty confessions made, and the young man, a dentist, took his stand fully with us again on the truth, to take his part with the church in harmony with them to do what he could to be a blessing rather than a hindrance. Brother Guenin bore a good testimony. He stated that he had for years been laboring for a brother who has light upon the truth, but did not take his position for the Sabbath. This was the cross. In the week of prayer he made earnest prayer to God in his behalf and was sure the Lord would hear and answer. The result was that his brother, working upon the Sabbath, told his family that the seventh day was the Sabbath, and he should keep it. He said his tools that he used in his work seemed heavy as though they would drop from his hands.

Dr. Kellogg claims this has been done, and for a time it nearly unbalanced him. We have worked to the best of our ability in this case to help the mind of the doctor by urging him, if he felt that a wrong had been done him, to lay the case before God, and not permit it to bear heavily upon him.

If they have not been open or frank, and have not observed the golden rule, I hope they will make every crooked thing straight. Dr. K. advanced money and helped Dr. Maxson and wife to obtain an education for the medical profession, and he has had hopes that they would come up to be able helpers and was depending on her especially as a lady physician.

He does not go through with a relation of his good deeds. He felt his case was so desperate that no angel could help him. He was before the holy heart-searching God of heaven who reads the secrets of the heart. He must have help, he needed mercy and grace, and he had no claim upon God for this at all. How could he tell how the case would turn with him? It was a solemn moment, he was looking forward to the judgment, and onward to eternity. He bowed his head and smote his breast and threw himself upon the mercy of a sin-pardoning Saviour. Humility is not a mistaken sense of inferiority, which results from a false standard. Whatever a man thinks true excellence consists in, he will think humbly of himself for not possessing it; false humility consists in not condemning oneself for not reaching a false imaginary standard, and this degrades the soul. But true humility consists in recognizing the inferiority that mortals are subject to and feeling our utter and entire dependence upon God.

Their son had taken a wrong course and there was alienation between him and his father’s family and did not attend meetings. He also broke down and confessed with deep feeling. Another man who had been wrong confessed. We had a very interesting social meeting, the Spirit of God was in our midst, softening and subduing the souls of our brethren and sisters. Bro. Guenin made interesting remarks. He said he had for years been praying for his brother that he might see and take hold of the truth. During the Week of Prayer he made this case a special subject of prayer. He went to see him to see if he could not do something to convince him of the truth. He found his brother deeply convicted, but was not ready to take his stand. About two weeks since, while working on Friday towards sundown, his tools seemed so heavy that it seemed he must drop them and keep the Sabbath, which he did. The tract Sufferings of Christ brought the decision that he would not break another Sabbath. He told his employer what his intentions were, expecting to lose his place, but he was told to go right on with his work. Bro. Guenin was filled with joy and says there is another man of much influence who is also convicted of the truth. I sought to impress upon them the importance of feeling a greater interest for those who know not the truth, and all resolved that they would take hold as they had never done before. They had had but little faith, but they would seek God and become missionaries in seeking to be co-laborers with God. There was a determination to give themselves up to God with all their heart.

We live to God, not to men. God estimates our work at its full value. He measures nobility of character; and whether men appreciate us or not in our lifetime, our character lives after we are gone.

In our association with men, we are bound by the law of Jehovah to influence them in the direction of good. This power of personal influence will be felt by others. The law of God requires that we love our fellow men as we love ourselves. Then every power and action of the mind must be put forth to that end—to do the greatest amount of good. To overdo wearies and disables us, and cripples the powers God has given us, so that much less good is done than might have been accomplished had we worked intelligently.

This very first lesson given them is not in God’s order. Let them work in their own harness and not wear Saul’s armor, but work as best they can in their own way and with their own humble talent.

When you present to them even a skeleton of a discourse, a synopsis or anything of the kind, you are doing a work which wearies you; and just as far as you go in this direction, you are doing them great injury. I speak decidedly on this point. You must give God a chance to work upon mind and upon heart. You must not take the work out of God’s hand to do yourself. This is the testimony I have borne to many. Your brother said that he had lost a book valuable to him because it contained many valuable discourses. I told him that every sermon he had ever preached that was put into writing or print was lost. I thought it was the greatest blessing that could come to him, for he did not see the necessity of preparing himself before entering the pulpit by diligently searching the Bible and opening his heart to the impressions of the Holy Spirit.

These men, if God accepts them, will have to seek their knowledge from the Scriptures and will have to search and pray and think. They will often be discouraged and driven to God for enlightenment. Now these men must come up in this way. Your thoughts are not to be put into their heads. They may get a lesson like a school boy from your discourses and repeat your arguments; it may be as dry as the hills of Gilboa that had neither dew nor rain. You are in danger of educating whoever is with you too much after your order. Let these men work their way, looking constantly to God for guidance, not to yourself.

Great favors have been asked and granted to have students come to Healdsburg College at the very lowest rates, and they are constantly expecting to draw favors, but have done nothing to reciprocate these favors.

We must be imbued with the Spirit of Christ. But let us consider what is gained by allowing our feelings to have control. If you rise superior to slights and to supposed injustice and wrong and act calmly and go right along doing your duty without talking of your difficulties, for this only irritates the soul, but leave it all with Jesus, you will gain precious victories and show yourself a man in the sight of God. Show yourself to be a man of tender compassion, one who will practice the virtues of Christ. When you allow these aggravating things to unbalance you, then you injure and wound yourself and others. You can have moral elevation by keeping calm under provocation. Satan and all his emissaries delight to see that you can be plagued and irritated and unbalanced and overborne by the deep-laid plots of Satan. Be at peace with your brother at once. You cannot afford to let a day pass without your doing this. Make no reference to what he has done to you, judge not his motives. Your duty is to be reconciled to your brother, and bring peace and pardon to your own soul, in pardoning a supposed injury done to yourself. I know that will give you vantage ground over the enemy. Let nothing but wise and gentle words escape your lips. Should your brother meet with sudden death and the matter stay unsettled between you—I cannot bear the supposition—I want you to be in fellowship as brethren.

Now God made an infinite sacrifice in giving Jesus, His beloved Son, to become a sacrifice for sin, that God may now say, without violating one principle of His government, “Yield yourself up to Me, give Me that will, take it from the control of Satan, and I will take possession of it, I will work in you to will and to do My good pleasure.” Then He gives you the mind of Christ, the will becomes transformed and the character formed after Christ’s character.

And let us look at every token of good; acknowledge all the Lord has done with grateful hearts. Because you do not see the same results in Old England that you did in Australia, you should not demerit that which has already been gained. There are some precious souls in Grimsby, in Ulceby, and others will be gathered in. There are some good souls in Southampton, and the brother I met at Brother Jones’, and the few who are connected with him, are, I judge, good material. Because they do not see every point just as we do requires wisdom in treating their cases, that we should unite wherever we can and not make the breach any greater between us. That Sister Griffen, I believe, will come to the front if wise management is exercised in her case. Such ones must not be left indifferently, but efforts should be made to bring them into the noble truth. We want that woman as a worker. All such talent, we must understand the faculty of winning to the truth. It is a nice work to hunt up the sheep and to make every exertion to bring them in. It will take time to rid them of all their strange ideas and erratic views, but we must be patient and not drive them from us. God is working with them; and as I look over the past, I see discouragements just as great that we have had to master and still have to contend with as in Old England, notwithstanding the caste of society and the difficulties to reach the higher classes. Now, my brother, be of good heart and notwithstanding the work may move slowly, nevertheless it moves. Thank God for that, but however we may view the work, in no case put in print one single word as though there had not much been done.

French and German elements seemed bound to not harmonize, and there were no real regulations and rules. It has taken all the efforts that could be put into action to make things work in harmony. The apprentices were learning. The trades and much care were needed with the elements that composed the working class to have things done with dispatch and correction. This is the same with the offices of publication, and these evils still exist. I know well about this matter. In Basel the additions to the church have been doubled. The church at Chaux-de-Fonds numbered only about six members. Now through Bro. Ertzenberger’s labors, the church increased, having sixteen added. And since that time there have been thorough efforts made by different ones and still more added from the very best class of society, until this is a church numbering 50 members. At Lausanne there was, I believe, only one keeping the Sabbath, and now there is a church of 35 through efforts made by Elders Bourdeau, Conradi, and Ertzenberger. Tramelan has 32 members.

No man, it was stated, obliged another to pay tithes. God did not make it a matter of compulsion any more than He compelled men to keep the Sabbath. It was God’s Sabbath, His holy time, and to be sacredly regarded by man.

It was that of preparing men by thorough training for the ministry before giving them license. They have been permitted to try their gift when they had not proper preparation, either in school education or in Bible knowledge, to warrant their going into the work, for they needed a great work done for them. First, every licentiate should be critically examined in his knowledge of the Scriptures before being sent into the field to teach others. This has not been done, and a very unsuccessful work has been done by many, and they could bring in no report of success. This discouraged themselves, and also disheartened the conference, so that their time and labor was, they deemed, unworthy of much wages; and this discouraged them still more and discouraged many from giving themselves to the work who, with the proper painstaking, thorough instruction and training, might have made thorough workmen and able ministers.

In contrast to deeds of that council, uprooting truth and righteousness; in contrast to their cruelty to Huss, the martyr’s constancy, his faith, his example, has been reflecting its light down along the times for centuries. His example has been encouraging others to submit their souls and bodies to God alone, to exalt God alone and take the Scriptures as their guide. This will make them the light of the world. This will make them examples of faith and courage and steadfastness in truth. This will nerve them to suffer and to endure, gaining victories even in sorrow and in death.

He may cherish his exacting habits in regard to his diet until he shall be disagreeable to himself and all connected with him. If he were obliged to labor according to his strength, hunger would give him a relish for his food and remove his murmuring. Decided measures should be taken in this matter.

He loved us and gave Himself for us that we might have eternal life. The feet of Christ were already bending in the path which led to Calvary. The hour of the great temptation was upon Him.

And they understood none of these things; this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.” [Luke 18:31-34.] “Then Peter took him and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee Lord, this shall not be unto you. But he turned and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me Satan, thou are an offense unto me, for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.” [Matthew 16:22, 23.] The words spoken by Peter were prompted by affection. How did Jesus regard them? Did He welcome them as a solace to His troubles? No, He rebuked the disciple because all this affection expressed was opposed to the mind and will of God and as such was offensive to the world’s Redeemer. Without giving the least excuse for Peter’s love that prompted him to speak as he did, the rebuke, most severe, came from the lips of Christ to Peter that he should, through his own human wishes, turn aside the purposes of God.

Their argument is that this statement of yours will not stand the Bible test, as Christ Himself declares that no man knoweth the day or the hour, no not even the angels of God, hence [you] have withdrawn the first editions and revised them leaving out the above, [and] also printed a tract declaring we are not a class of people who set the time, (entitled Is the Time Near?)”"},{"refcode_short":"5LtMs, Lt 38, 1888, par. 6","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 5 (1887-1888), Lt 38, 1888, par. 6","content":"Will these good friends who are troubled concerning these statements please ask the individuals who claim to have the original copy of [the] first edition to let them see the statement they claim it contains.

For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness; God is witness; nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ, but we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children.” [1 Thessalonians 2:1-7.]"},{"refcode_short":"5LtMs, Lt 48, 1888, par. 7","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 5 (1887-1888), Lt 48, 1888, par. 7","content":"“I am made a minister (of the church), according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God; even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints; to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory: Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus: whereunto I also labor, striving according to His working, which worketh in me mightily.” [Colossians 1:25-29.]"},{"refcode_short":"5LtMs, Lt 48, 1888, par. 8","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 5 (1887-1888), Lt 48, 1888, par. 8","content":"The Lord requires more of you than merely to minister; He requires you to bind off your work.

Years ago, when the mission first started in Europe, some of the sisters thought they would do me a great favor, and they bought me a good American silk dress that cost $45.00. It was just at the time that Brother Andrews needed means to use in the mission in Europe. I took the dress and sold it for $50.00 and sent the money to him to use in the cause, and it came just in the right time, and I was so thankful. And while we were over in Europe, we were at Nimes, France; they wanted means so much to live upon, and they could not get it. The minister there had to meet a debt and knew not where the money was coming from, and he just laid his head on the table and cried. Just then we received the money that had been sent from California, and we gave him the money needed. Then he cried again for joy, because the Lord had answered our prayers and the money had come just in time. So we know how these things go. Now, when you are tempted to get a rich dress, just ask yourself if you cannot get as much satisfaction out of one that does not cost so much, and then you can put the money you have saved into the treasury of God. Just begin to see if you cannot work in this direction. I do not begrudge a cent that I have put into the cause, and I have kept on until my husband and myself have about 30,000 invested in the cause of God. We did this a little at a time, and the Lord saw that He could trust these Daniels with His means and that we would not bestow it on ourselves. He kept pouring it in and we kept letting it out.

During my stay there I was introduced to a tall man—how tall shall I say he was?—over six feet tall and well proportioned. When he took my hand he seemed much affected and said, “I am so glad to meet you; I am thankful that I can speak with you.” After going into the tent, a brother came in and said, “That man has a history.” Then he went on and told how a year before he had been converted; how he had once kept the Sabbath but had gone back, and how he claimed that he never had been converted. Then after he gave up the truth, he went back into the company of hard cases, and Satan took complete possession of him. Two or three were linked with him in his wickedness, men who would not want it to be known that they were in such business. They stole and did wickedness in every way. He was not a licentious man; he had a wife and he respected her. She was a Sabbathkeeper, and he would not allow a word to be said against her. This was the position he took; he loved her, but not enough to stop his evil course. He did not care for the spoil of his robberies, but did them for the enjoyment he found in them. Well, Elder [E. P.] Daniels was holding meetings, and he was speaking on confession. What was said seemed to take hold of this man’s mind, and he could not resist. He seemed to turn white and then left the tent.

The heavenly universe will rejoice, and souls who are now under temptation and the frown of God will be won to Christ. Shall we not clear away the darkness by doing the work God has given us to do? We are laborers together with God. Jesus is waiting to work in us and by us and through us to will and to do of His good pleasure. If we neglect the Lord’s heritage and feel little burden for the church and souls perishing in their sins, we are condemned by God for not strengthening that which was ready to die. If, as Christ’s overseers, we do our work with an eye single to the glory of God, there is no reason why the church should be weak, faithless and corrupt. Let the watchmen on the walls of Zion awake. Let them do their duty with fidelity. They need so much the heavenly endowment, that they may be laborers together with God in the great plan of salvation."},{"refcode_short":"5LtMs, Ms 8a, 1888, par. 55","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 5 (1887-1888), Ms 8a, 1888, par. 55","content":"To those who have been true and faithful, Christ will say, “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” “Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.” [Matthew 25:34, 21.] All who enter the kingdom of heaven as conquerors will understand the meaning of this benediction, for they will have done the work Christ has given them to do.

For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.” [John 6:53-55.] In explanation of these words, Christ said, “It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life.” [Verse 63.] We must take His Word and bring it into our nature and thus receive nourishment from Christ.

My son said he would speak in behalf of his mother, who was just as desirous—and more so now [that] Elder Waggoner had spoken—to hear all that was to be said on the other side of the question; and she had spoken thus decidedly in the council of the ministers the night before.

The power of the truth is not revealed in their character. They talk about the law of God but practice neither doctrines nor the truth in their life. Sin is bound up with their heart and interwoven into their character, and they have no courage or confidence to put forth earnest labor, for they know that Christ is not brought into living connection with their life practices. They have separated their souls from God by their own wicked works; they do not love God supremely, neither do they love their neighbor as themselves, and their labor is void of real results."},{"refcode_short":"5LtMs, Ms 27, 1888, par. 6","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 5 (1887-1888), Ms 27, 1888, par. 6","content":"“Without me,” says Christ, “ye can do nothing.” [John 15:5.] Ambassadors of Jesus Christ must be in living, constant communion with God.

I spoke to the people assembled in tent meeting eleven times. This was a meeting requiring hard labor with some excellent, good results. My tent was pitched close by an irrigating ditch. It was a beautiful location for me. The tent was made very comfortable with stove, carpet on floor, and furniture. But there were leaders [drain pipes] from the ditch which kept it damp and wet under and in front of my tent. The result on me was loss of appetite and general debility and high fever. The cause of this I could not at first understand, but some of my brethren moved my tent up on dry ground and the disagreeable illness was in a great measure removed."},{"refcode_short":"5LtMs, Ms 28, 1888, par. 2","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 5 (1887-1888), Ms 28, 1888, par. 2","content":"We left the campground Sunday night, June 3.

We tarried overnight with Brother Church and early next morning I felt urged by the Spirit of the Lord to write several pages of letter to Doctors Caldwell and Gibbs, speaking to them some very plain things in reference to the institution, trying to impress upon them the importance of keeping up their dignity as Christian gentlemen and physicians of that institution. They must never become common in their conversation or their manners and attitude and never approach to anything of the kind of breaking down the reserve and modesty which should ever be encouraged to exist between men and women.

It is a shame to speak of the things done in secret to gratify the animal nature of the man. It is simply a dreadful thing. And to have ladies treated by men physicians is not right when the secret parts are to be opened to the sight of men. [It] is a science that never should be encouraged.
