He fits His intercessions to the needs of each soul, as He did in the case of Peter. Peter himself had not the clear perception necessary to an understanding of his danger. Christ said to him, “Behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.” [Luke 22:31, 32.] Our Advocate fills His mouth with arguments to teach His tried, tempted ones to brace against Satan’s temptations. He interprets every movement of the enemy. He orders events. He sends messages to His people, especially to those in leading positions; and He teaches us how to pray with fervency and hold fast with importunity. He would have every soul come to Him with their trials, and not open these trials to men who are sorely tempted and whose lips will be filled with arguments against the ways and methods of the Lord. Those whose ears are opened to hear these arguments will feel aggrieved and will enter into temptation."},{"refcode_short":"21LtMs, Lt 90, 1906, par. 6","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 21 (1906), Lt 90, 1906, par. 6","content":"“Ye are My friends,” Christ said, “if ye do whatsoever I command you.” [John 15:14.] Why do we not practice the truth as Christ practiced it? I am instructed to say that a decided change is to be made in the spirit and the example of Christ’s professed followers, before they can understand what Christ is to them, and what all who claim to believe the truth may be if they glorify God. We must have the faith that works manifestly by love and purifies the soul; then there will be seen in the practice such love and tenderness that the Lord Jesus will be glorified in every church and in every sanitarium and school. But a decided work needs to be done before the work carried on in our sanitariums will be effectual in the conversion of the sick and afflicted, before Christ can be revealed in the simplicity of true godliness. Christ does not recognize a people who entertain the idea that their capabilities are a perfect whole and that they must have the first and highest place.

Had the word that God gave during the meeting been heeded, there would have been a general time of humiliation and confession of sins before God, and the whole room would have been filled with the glory of God. But in the place of every soul humbling his own heart, clearing away the rubbish from the door, and making a way by which Christ might enter, some took a wrong course, like a car that jumps a track, and many words were spoken in an effort to lay blame upon others. Such words should never have been spoken.

Of some whom I shall not at this time name, the words were spoken, “Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.” [Verse 1.] The scornful were there, their spirit unsubdued, unhumbled. They were burning for a chance to condemn and to pass judgment upon others. They had been walking contrary to God. The Lord had given them gracious words of encouragement, declaring that if they would take hold of His strength, they would make peace with Him. Words were given me for these men. In vision I was permitted to see the very work that Christ was waiting to do for them. While they were sliding over the precipice into the black waters below, a hand was stretched out to save them and place them on vantage ground. This was the time for them to grasp the hand of Him who “is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them.” [Hebrews 7:25.] Jesus could have saved them if they had humbled their hearts before God. There was, I was shown, an abundance for them to confess, in order to free their souls from guilt. But they chose to sit in the seat of the scornful. Rich blessings would have been bestowed upon them, had they improved the opportunity so graciously offered them. Very precious victories would then have been gained. But they did not improve the opportunity. They left the meeting less impressible than they were when they came. They refused to humble their proud hearts. They took up their burden of sin, and carried it away with them, to continue to dishonor God and to rob their souls of the salvation Christ was waiting to bestow."},{"refcode_short":"21LtMs, Lt 216, 1906, par. 16","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 21 (1906), Lt 216, 1906, par. 16","content":"Here is the description of another party—one who will learn of Christ: “But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in His law doth he meditate day and night.

This unity cannot be a mechanical thing. It must be a living experience in the heart, and the Lord alone can give that experience. I do not know how we can do this, unless we take the time to talk more about it. (1 Corinthians 2:2): “For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.” Paul had one topic, he had one theme, one great question. You know he said, “This one thing I do.” [Philippians 3:13.] Jesus said to Martha, “One thing is needful.” [Luke 10:42.] David said, “One thing have I desired.” [Psalm 27:4.] Now there is but one theme, one thing in this world, under the shining sun, that is worthy of the attention of men, and that is this theme—the gospel of Jesus Christ. We should abandon ourselves altogether to the one great question. That certainly teaches us the oneness of God’s great work. I understand that everything connected with the third angel’s message is of this one great theme. The third angel’s message in all its fulness is the gospel in all its fulness. It is not a part of the gospel; it is not a feature of the gospel; it is not an appendage of the gospel. It is the gospel itself. It is the gospel given to the world today in a fulness that has never been revealed before. It is the gospel given to man as certainly as it has not been preached since apostolic times. Jesus did proclaim a complete gospel, but light has been shining forth, and now in these last days God would have all that is intended for humanity before translation to come out now. Of course we shall see more and more of it—it will take eternity to reveal all these things. If we have anything in our work that we cannot pray for, that we cannot be swallowed up in, we ought to cut it off at once. Take the different lines of work. The evangelical work, of going out and preaching to the people, giving Bible readings, visiting from house to house; and church work, we look upon that as purely gospel work. It is. But the gospel work is not limited to that. We have the work of distributing literature, sowing reading matter all over the world. There is no denomination in the world that has such a fine, rich literature as we have. We have a message to give to the people in a short time—every nation, kindred, tongue, and people—that we must save as far as it is possible to save them; and in this age it cannot be done without distributing literature everywhere. In order to do that, we must have facilities for doing that. God has raised up men who have given their minds to that, and He has provided facilities that are wonderful for that purpose.

For I do not distinguish between the medical and the gospel—the gospel is a medical work. The gospel is the work of not only presenting the great truths which must be received in order to become sanctified through the truth, but it must embrace all that Christ embraced in ministering. It is ministering to the sick; it is ministering in the gospel. It is working at the right hand and working at the left hand. It is doing the work intelligently for God and suffering men, and that is the important work that is to be done at this present time. There is to be no division in that work in our institutions.

But it is just as much a physician’s duty to prepare a soul for eternity as to minister to the body, to prepare the soul before him for what is to take place. If you see they are in danger, it is your duty to tell them that they are in danger. You could not neglect to do this and be a faithful steward.

That is always represented in that light and has always been presented in that light until more recently. Now they say, The Lord has shown Sister White that this work is just like the arm to the body; the Lord has shown her that. And it has been urged that because it was that work, there should be oneness of responsibility. That is so. It is as the arm is to the body. Now God wants all of us to have an interest in all the medical work. That is, Christ was bound all up in this work. It was the whole work. You see, He made no division at all. He did not feel that He was infringing on physicians, or anything like that, but He just proclaimed the truth; and when He saw the sick, He came right to them and asked if they believed that He would make them whole, or could make them whole; and some at once responded.

When Christ healed the paralytic, the very first work He had to do for that man was to give him peace of mind. He knew that that man was so disturbed, because the priests and rulers had always said to him, “It is your sins, it is your sins,” and that God has cast him off. There was no hope for him because of his sins. That is what they were always saying, and the poor man was left where there was no hope; but the very first word Christ uttered was Peace, that his sins were forgiven. That very thing was what he wanted. And O what peace and joy came into his heart. In regard to Christ, they began to abuse Him at once; but, says He, “that ye may know that the Son of man hath power to forgive sins, He says to the paralytic, Take up your bed and go to thy house.” [Matthew 9:6.]"},{"refcode_short":"21LtMs, Ms 132, 1906, par. 37","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 21 (1906), Ms 132, 1906, par. 37","content":"There are the two blending.

Every morning I felt as if possibly it might be the last morning I should see."},{"refcode_short":"21LtMs, Ms 146, 1906, par. 13","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 21 (1906), Ms 146, 1906, par. 13","content":"But at the camp meeting held in Oakland, the blessing of the Lord came upon me; and although I felt great weakness at the beginning of that meeting, yet I stood up before a large congregation in the mammoth tent; and as I began to speak, the blessing of God rested upon me in a very special manner. Every time I spoke during that meeting (six or seven times in all, besides laboring sometimes for those who came forward for prayers), I had not a weary feeling in my body. I felt like one refreshed. I felt like one upon whom the blessing of God was resting. I was very thankful indeed for His presence. Since that meeting, most of my time has been spent in writing and in speaking; and yet I am thankful to be able to say that the Lord has preserved me, so that I feel no discomfort healthwise.

The impression of the most sacred character was to create awe and bring the people to repentance. It was something that was permitted of God to [show] God's displeasure against idolatrous sacrifices. How could any gift be acceptable when the whole process was an abomination to the Lord?"},{"refcode_short":"21LtMs, Ms 153, 1906, par. 8","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 21 (1906), Ms 153, 1906, par. 8","content":"The religious sacrifices were an abomination to God, a reproach to the people. The altar was rent under the pronunciation, and the act would cause much notoriety. That hand that was stretched out to the seizing of the man of God was in vain. He could not fulfil his [purpose]. He insulted the man of God whose hand was sacred, but the cry to the altar had a most decided rebuke. The wrath of man was restrained and judgment [came] upon the man who should attempt to seize the man of God. His arm and hand were helpless. But at his earnest request to pray for him, the hand was healed [even] in his abominations. This was a reproach to all Israel and their hearts were hardened as the stones which composed the altar. Thus was Jeroboam so filled with defiance against God that he assaulted the man who brought him the message."},{"refcode_short":"21LtMs, Ms 153, 1906, par. 9","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 21 (1906), Ms 153, 1906, par. 9","content":"What kind of a lesson is this to all those who shall live under such misconceived opinions?
