Satan, with all his agencies, is working to hold God’s people back from giving all their powers to His service. But as a people we are to be active and decidedly in earnest, improving every opportunity to increase our usefulness in religious lines. We are to be “not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.” [Romans 12:11.] Possessing true godliness and a knowledge of the Word of God, every church member may become a working agency, laboring with dignity and confidence, yet with humble dependence, remembering the words of Christ to His first disciples, “I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves.” [Luke 10:3; Matthew 10:16.] We need to exercise wisdom in all our ways if we would work in the name and fear of God. Unfeigned faith is what we need; for faith is “the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” [Hebrews 11:1.]"},{"refcode_short":"23LtMs, Lt 244, 1908, par. 2","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 23 (1908), Lt 244, 1908, par. 2","content":"I have visited the Huntsville School, and I believe that it has many advantages for the carrying on of the work of an all-round education.

When strength failed, and the will power weakened, and faith ceased to repose in God, then those who had stood long and valiantly for the right were overcome. Moses was wearied with the forty years’ wandering of Israel, when for the moment his faith let go its hold upon infinite power. He failed just upon the borders of the promised land. So with Elijah who had stood undaunted before King Ahab, who had faced the whole nation of Israel with the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal at their head. After that terrible day upon Carmel, when the false prophets had been slain and the people had declared their allegiance to God, Elijah fled for his life before the threats of idolatrous Jezebel. Thus Satan has taken advantage of the weakness of humanity. And he will still work in the same way. Whenever one is encompassed with clouds, perplexed by circumstances, or afflicted by poverty or distress, Satan is at hand to tempt and annoy. He attacks our weak points of character. He seeks to shake our confidence in God, who suffers such a condition of things to exist. We are tempted to distrust God, to question His love. Often the tempter comes to us as he came to Christ, arraying before us our weakness and infirmities. He hopes to discourage the soul and to break our hold upon God. Then he is sure of his prey.

This is a time of spiritual darkness in the churches of the world. Ignorance of divine things has hidden God and the truth from view. The forces of evil are gathering in strength. Satan flatters his co-workers that he will do a work that will captivate the world. While partial inactivity has come upon the church, Satan and his host are intensely active. The professed Christian churches are not converting the world; for they are themselves corrupted with selfishness and pride and need to feel the converting power of God in their midst before they can lead others to a purer or higher standard."},{"refcode_short":"23LtMs, Ms 23, 1908, par. 2","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 23 (1908), Ms 23, 1908, par. 2","content":"An Encouraging Experience"},{"refcode_short":"23LtMs, Ms 23, 1908, par. 3","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 23 (1908), Ms 23, 1908, par. 3","content":"The afternoon of March 3 I spent in counsel with Brother and Sister Haskell, discussing the work in Oakland and their plans to go east to spend some time in south Lancaster.

Here is W. C. White and here is Dores Robinson and here is a people that love God and keep His commandments. We want to draw nigh to God. We want Him to draw nigh to us. We want a living religion, and to act as though we had a Saviour that could sustain us in every trial and in every difficulty. We cannot see the end from the beginning, but God can. And we want to know that He will not afflict us willingly, nor grieve the hearts of the children of men. “Behold what manner of love ... as he is.” [1 John 3:1, 2.] As a living Saviour, He will reward every man or woman according to their works.

Jones visited me and set before me that if I would reduce my income on my large books from twenty cents a copy to ten cents, they would pledge themselves to give to my books the very first attention, and put their best workers on my books. I was heavily in debt in the preparation of these books. I was so urged [about] how many more they would sell, I finally consented. Then Bible Readings was thrust in without regard to the promise made me, and the publishing houses dropped the sale of my books. And [what is] more, the managing was [such] that the book Bible Readings should have the right of way and the ones handling books were charged to handle only Bible Readings and thus they did."},{"refcode_short":"23LtMs, Ms 142, 1908, par. 2","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 23 (1908), Ms 142, 1908, par. 2","content":"Many were not satisfied.

Nevertheless that charge was given to all our camp meetings. They were not to handle any books except the one, Bible Readings, and Brother C. H. Jones, who made that promise himself, did not keep his word. Neither did they release me from the promise I had made. I was in debt for the printing of these books, and when I was encouraged to pledge one thousand dollars for the sanitarium in Chicago, I was assured I should have that made up to me. My leading out brought in a large sum in donations, but there stood my debt at seven percent interest for years. They have never corrected that wrong move done me, and that I should have had for years to pay interest on 3,000 dollars is not a right thing to do.

I talked to Captain Eldridge and Frank Belden, who were standing then at the head of the office, but not one word of encouragement came to me. Recently, [just] as years ago, light was given me that I should have justice, strict justice, on my books; that the revenue coming to me should have come ever since the contract was made null and void by their setting entirely aside as far as possible the handling of my books. I have been instructed that it was a mistake for them to even ask me to receive so low a price on my books; and that the very loss in consequence [of that mishandling] was my just due; and that the conference had better handle the matter of this unfair dealing because it was an unrighteous, unfair, transaction."},{"refcode_short":"23LtMs, Ms 142, 1908, par. 4","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 23 (1908), Ms 142, 1908, par. 4","content":"I was instructed that if the books had been widely circulated the light would have come to the people and a different showing would be revealed.
