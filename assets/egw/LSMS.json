A few years after her birth the family moved to Portland, where most of her early life was spent. Her father, Robert Harmon, was a man of acknowledged integrity, and an earnest, devoted Christian. Her mother was also a devout Christian of amiable disposition, and of marked activity in all enterprises for the relief of the poor and afflicted. They were members of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in which they were prominent laborers for the conversion of sinners, and for the upbuilding of the cause of God. This relation they maintained for forty years. During this time they had the joy of seeing their children, eight in number, all converted and gathered into the fold of Christ."},{"refcode_short":"LSMS 1.2","refcode_long":"Life Sketches Manuscript, p. 1.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"They were in humble circumstances, but they were industrious, self-reliant, and pious. The characteristic virtues which have rendered famous the earlier homes of New England,—such as reverence for God and respect for parental authority,—were early and firmly inculcated; and the children were faithfully taught, by both precept and example, those lessons of integrity and diligence which have molded the characters of many of the world's noblest workers. Every morning and evening they had family worship, and sang the praises of God."},{"refcode_short":"LSMS 1.3","refcode_long":"Life Sketches Manuscript, p. 1.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Both the parents possessed a large degree of physical endurance, and the children inherited this blessing, as also the activity, force of character, and executive ability, which were especially developed in the mother."},{"refcode_short":"LSMS 2.1","refcode_long":"Life Sketches Manuscript, p. 2.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In Ellen, both mental and physical development was rapid and vigorous. While but a child, she displayed a love of study, a quick perception, and a retentive memory. She was of a buoyant, hopeful disposition, fond of society, courageous, resolute, and persevering. It was but natural that her parents should regard her with peculiar interest, and entertain high hopes for her future. But by a painful accident, the circumstances of which are related in her own language in the first chapter following, these hopes appeared to be utterly blighted."},{"refcode_short":"LSMS 2.2","refcode_long":"Life Sketches Manuscript, p. 2.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Young as she was, Ellen felt as keenly as her parents the disappointment occasioned by this apparent ruin of the prospects of her life. Instead of being a strong, self-reliant child, with buoyancy of spirit, she became feeble, timid, and despondent. But the noble qualities of her mind and heart were not destroyed; and the prospect of being deprived of the common pleasure of life, and perhaps of life itself, turned her attention to the higher joys of heaven. Naturally sensitive, and very conscientious, she realized, to an unusual degree for one so young, her need of the grace and mercy of God to enable her to endure the trials of life, and to fit her for the world to come; and she embraced the faith of Christ with all the ardor of her nature, and very early became noted for her piety and religious devotion."},{"refcode_short":"LSMS 2.3","refcode_long":"Life Sketches Manuscript, p. 2.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The following is the account of her religious experience as written by herself."},{"refcode_short":"LSMS 3","refcode_long":"Life Sketches Manuscript, p. 3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Chapter 1—Childhood"},{"refcode_short":"LSMS 3.1","refcode_long":"Life Sketches Manuscript, p. 3.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I was born at Gorham, Maine, November 26, 1827.

In company with my twin sister and one of our schoolmates, I was crossing a common in the city of Portland, ME, when a girl about thirteen years of age, becoming angry at some trifle, followed us, threatening to strike us. Our parents had taught us never to contend with anyone, but if we were in danger of being abused or injured, to hasten home at once. We were doing this with all speed, but the girl followed us as rapidly with a stone in her hand. I turned my head to see how far she was behind us, and as I did so, she threw the stone and it hit me on the nose. I was stunned by the blow, and fell senseless to the ground."},{"refcode_short":"LSMS 4.1","refcode_long":"Life Sketches Manuscript, p. 4.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"When consciousness returned, I found myself in a merchant's store, my garments covered with blood, which was pouring from my nose and streaming over the floor. A kind stranger offered to take me home in his carriage, but not realizing my weakness, I told him that I preferred to walk rather than soil his carriage. Those present were not aware that my injury was so serious, and allowed me to go; but after walking only a few rods, I grew faint and dizzy. My twin sister and my schoolmate carried me home about one half mile."},{"refcode_short":"LSMS 4.2","refcode_long":"Life Sketches Manuscript, p. 4.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I have no recollection of anything further for some time after the accident. My mother said that I noticed nothing, but lay in a stupor for three weeks. No one but herself thought it possible for me to recover; but for some reason she felt that I would live. A kind neighbor, who had been very much interested in my behalf, at one time thought me to be dying. She wished to purchase a burial robe for me, but my mother said, “Not yet;” for something told her that I would not die. The neighbors finally did make the robe but it was never used by me."},{"refcode_short":"LSMS 4.3","refcode_long":"Life Sketches Manuscript, p. 4.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"When I aroused to consciousness, it seemed to me that I had been asleep. I did not remember the accident, and was ignorant for the cause of my illness. A great cradle had been made for me, and in it I lay for many weeks. As I began to gain a little strength, my curiosity was aroused by overhearing those who came to visit me say, “What a pity!”“I should not have known her,” etc. I asked for a looking glass, but at first was refused. When I was allowed to have it, I was shocked at the change in my appearance. Every feature of my face seemed altered. The bone of my nose had been broken, and had to be removed; this caused the disfigurement. Friends who visited us looked with pity upon me, and advised my parents to prosecute the father of the girl. But my mother was for peace; she said that if such a course would bring me back my health and natural looks, there would be something gained; but as this was impossible, it was best not to make enemies by following such advice."},{"refcode_short":"LSMS 5.1","refcode_long":"Life Sketches Manuscript, p. 5.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Physicians thought that a silver wire might be put in my nose to hold it in shape. This would have been very painful, and they feared it would be of little use, as I had lost so much blood and sustained such a severe shock that my recovery was very doubtful.

I could see no pleasure in my existence. I did not wish to live, and yet feared to die, for I was unprepared. When Christian friends visited the family, they would ask my mother if she had talked to me about dying. I overheard this, and it roused me, and I began to pray the Lord to prepare me for death. I desired to become a Christian, and prayed earnestly for the forgiveness of my sins. A peace of mind resulted. I loved every one, and felt desirous that all should have their sins forgiven, and love Jesus as I did."},{"refcode_short":"LSMS 5.4","refcode_long":"Life Sketches Manuscript, p. 5.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I well remember one night.

The neighbors were very much frightened. Mother took me out of bed in her arms, and carried me to the window. I was happy, for I thought Jesus was coming, and I longed to see Him. My heart was full; I clapped my hands for joy, and thought my sufferings were ended.

I could not weep readily, as could my twin sister; though my heart was heavy, and ached as if it were breaking, I could not shed a tear.

The same girl who was the cause of my misfortune, was appointed monitor by our teacher, and it was among her duties to assist me in my writing and other lessons. She always seemed sincerely sorry for the great injury she had done me, although I was careful not to remind her of it. She was tender and patient with me, and seemed sad and thoughtful as she saw me laboring under serious disadvantages to get an education. As I endeavored to bend my mind to my studies, the letters on the page would run together, great drops of perspiration would stand on my brow, and a faintness and dizziness would come over me.

When, a few years afterward, I was speaking in general meetings, I met this man again; and at the close of my discourse he asked, “How did you get that wonderful voice?” I told him that the Lord had given it to me. (When I began my public labors I had no voice, except when I stood before the congregation to speak. At other times I could not speak above a whisper.) “And,” I added, “I have often thought of what you said to the people when some one asked you how you became a minister. You told them that your friends said you could never be a minister, because you could not speak properly; but you went away by yourself, and talked to the trees in the woods; and then when driving oxen, you would talk to them just as if you were in a meeting. ‘This,’ you said, ‘is the way I learned to speak in public.’”"},{"refcode_short":"LSMS 10.1","refcode_long":"Life Sketches Manuscript, p. 10.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"My teachers advised me to leave school, and not pursue my studies further until my health should improve."},{"refcode_short":"LSMS 10.2","refcode_long":"Life Sketches Manuscript, p. 10.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Three years later I made another effort to obtain an education, by entering a seminary for young ladies in Portland.

I felt that henceforth I was not of this world, but had risen from the watery grave into a newness of life. The same day in the afternoon I was received into the church in full membership. A young woman stood by my side who was also a candidate for admission to the church. My mind was peaceful and happy till I noticed the gold rings glittering upon this sister's fingers, and the large, showy earrings in her ears. I then observed that her bonnet was adorned with artificial flowers, and trimmed with costly ribbons arranged in bows and puffs.

If it was indeed as sinful as I supposed to imitate the extravagant dress of the worldings, surely these Christians would conform to the Bible standard. Yet for myself, I determined to follow my convictions of duty.

They exhausted all their influence and bodily strength to destroy the effect of the vision. They would unite in singing very loud, and then alternately would talk and read from the Bible, in a loud voice in order that she might not be heard, until their strength was exhausted, and their hands would shake so that they could not read from the Bible. But amidst all this confusion and noise, Ellen's clear and shrill voice, as she talked in vision, was distinctly heard by all present. The opposition of these men continued as long as they could talk and sing, notwithstanding some of their own friends rebuked them, and requested them to stop. ‘But,’ said Robbins, ‘you are bowed to an idol; you are worshiping a golden calf.’"},{"refcode_short":"LSMS 160","refcode_long":"Life Sketches Manuscript, p. 160 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The Open Bible Test"},{"refcode_short":"LSMS 160.1","refcode_long":"Life Sketches Manuscript, p. 160.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"“Mr. Thayer, the owner of the house, was not fully satisfied that her vision was of the devil, as Robbins declared it to be.
