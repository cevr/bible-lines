He desires that it shall be used to His glory. By it, man is enabled to co-operate with God in efforts to save perishing fellow mortals. We have none too much brainpower for reasoning facilities. We are to educate and train every power of mind and body—the human mechanism that Christ has bought—in order that we may put it to the best possible use.

Both expressed great satisfaction in listening to the discourse. The elder son grasped my hand and said, “My heart is melted within me. I never listened to such a discourse as you have given today.

The commendation of God does not rest upon the rebuilding of the sanitarium in Battle Creek. Warning after warning has been given that the work should not be centralized there, but that plants should be made in many places. Dr. Kellogg has now become so dazed by satanic agencies that he has no power from the snare to go from Battle Creek. He has no moral power to carry on the work at Battle Creek as a missionary enterprise under the sanctification of the Holy Spirit of God. He has so long defied God in doing his own will that he knows not God nor Jesus Christ through a sanctified, pure, righteous character. The Lord says, “Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.” [Exodus 20:3.] The idolatry of his own devising is yet to appear. The divine Lawgiver Himself is not respected and is not obeyed, and dummies are placed on the throne. For years moral darkness has been gathering around him and becoming more dense, his intense purpose being to devise ways of concealing his ingenious methods of unsanctified devising until his own sinful devising has been becoming exhausted and the divine displeasure has been increasing, ready to discharge upon him any moment. Those who have linked themselves with him need to break from the fellowship at once. I have no words from the Lord to commend a course of action which will lead him to suppose that they are in full sympathy with him.

Thus we shall prepare for a place in the mansions that Christ has gone to prepare for those who love Him. “Let not your hearts be troubled,” He said, “ye believe in God, believe also in Me. In My Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself, that where I am, there ye may be also.” [John 14:1-3.] These mansions He is preparing for those who accept the invitation, “Come unto Me, ... and I will give you rest.” [Matthew 11:28.] This is the highest science that we can possibly obtain, but those who refuse Christ will never understand it. The Word of God, studied and obeyed, fits men and women for entrance into the higher courts. Those who are striving to be true Christians have the constant guardianship of heavenly angels; for they are laborers together with God, working to glorify Him in the world."},{"refcode_short":"19LtMs, Ms 83, 1904, par. 6","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 19 (1904), Ms 83, 1904, par. 6","content":"It is to be our constant effort to reveal the attributes that Christ revealed when He was in the world.
