Another section is devoted to brief collections of statements on a variety of specific matters, such as lawsuits, the International Date Line, renting Adventist churches to other groups, gardening, and music. The book closes with three significant appendices, giving W. C.

This act shows our dependence upon God.” It is also a sign of reverence: “There should be an intelligent knowledge of how to come to God in reverence and Godly fear with devotional love. There is a growing lack of reverence for our maker, a growing disregard of His greatness and His majesty.”—Manuscript 84b, 1897 (Quoted in Selected Messages 2:312.)

She had been for some years a proofreader in the Review and Herald, and Sister White received assurance through revelation that Sister Davis would be a conscientious and faithful helper. Later on Sister Eliza Burnham was employed by Sister White, and at one time Mrs. B. L. Whitney and Fannie Bolton were employed at Battle Creek as helpers when there was much work to do. Sister Davis was with Sister White in Europe in 1886 and 1887. She was also Sister White's principal helper in Australia."},{"refcode_short":"3SM 457.4","refcode_long":"Selected Messages Book 3, p. 457.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"As the work in Australia grew, Sister Burnham was called to assist in the book editing, and Maggie Hare and Minnie Hawkins were employed as copyists."},{"refcode_short":"3SM 457.5","refcode_long":"Selected Messages Book 3, p. 457.5 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I had forgotten to mention that during the years when Sister White was in Healdsburg, Sister J.

A.] Olsen [General Conference president.] in the early ‘90's should be reprinted—the matter to be grouped according to subjects. While this was under consideration, it happened that Elder W. A. Colcord, who had once been secretary of the General Conference and for many years a leading writer on religious liberty topics, was out of employment, and at my solicitations Sister White employed him to take the special testimonies and group the matter according to subjects for republication. He spent several weeks on this work and was paid by Sister White; but the work was never used. If I remember correctly, this was the extent of his connection with her literary work."},{"refcode_short":"3SM 458.1","refcode_long":"Selected Messages Book 3, p. 458.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The last work done by Sister Davis was the selection and arrangement of the matter used in Ministry of Healing."},{"refcode_short":"3SM 458.2","refcode_long":"Selected Messages Book 3, p. 458.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Elder C.

It was never considered by me or by any of Sister White's helpers that the personnel of her working force was of any primary interest to the readers of her books. She wrote the matter. She wrote very fully. There was always a controversy between her and the publishers regarding the quantity of matter that should be used. Sister White was best pleased when a subject was presented very fully, and the publishers were always bringing pressure to bear to have the matter condensed or abbreviated so that the book would not be too large. Consequently, after important chapters were prepared for the printer, and sometimes after they were sent to the printer, a new presentation of the subject would be given Sister White, and she would write additional matter and insist upon its being incorporated. This experience applied chiefly to the Great Controversy, Vol. IV."},{"refcode_short":"3SM 458.4","refcode_long":"Selected Messages Book 3, p. 458.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"A corresponding difficulty regarding the amount of matter prepared for Desire of Ages was overcome in part by the setting apart of portions which were used in Christ's Object Lessons and Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing."},{"refcode_short":"3SM 459.1","refcode_long":"Selected Messages Book 3, p. 459.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Regarding the reading of works of contemporary authors during the time of the preparation of these books, there is very little to be said, because, when Sister White was busily engaged in writing she had very little time to read. Previous to her work of writing on the life of Christ and during the time of her writing, to some extent, she read from the works of Hanna, Fleetwood, Farrar, and Geikie.

In a few of these scenes chronology and geography were clearly presented, but in the greater part of the revelation the flashlight scenes, which were exceedingly vivid, and the conversations and the controversies, which she heard and was able to narrate, were not marked geographically or chronologically, and she was left to study the Bible and history, and the writings of men who had presented the life of our Lord to get the chronological and geographical connection."},{"refcode_short":"3SM 460.1","refcode_long":"Selected Messages Book 3, p. 460.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Another purpose served by the reading of history and the Life of Our Lord [This may refer to William Hanna's Life of Our Lord (1863).] And the Life of St. Paul, was that in so doing there was brought vividly to her mind scenes presented clearly in vision, but which were through the lapse of years and her strenuous ministry, dimmed in her memory."},{"refcode_short":"3SM 460.2","refcode_long":"Selected Messages Book 3, p. 460.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Many times in the reading of Hanna, Farrar, or Fleetwood, she would run on to a description of a scene which had been vividly presented to her, but forgotten, and which she was able to describe more in detail than that which she had read."},{"refcode_short":"3SM 460.3","refcode_long":"Selected Messages Book 3, p. 460.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Notwithstanding all the power that God had given her to present scenes in the lives of Christ and His apostles and His prophets and His reformers in a stronger and more telling way than other historians, yet she always felt most keenly the results of her lack of school education. She admired the language in which other writers had presented to their readers the scenes which God had presented to her in vision, and she found it both a pleasure, and a convenience and an economy of time to use their language fully or in part in presenting those things which she knew through revelation, and which she wished to pass on to her readers."},{"refcode_short":"3SM 460.4","refcode_long":"Selected Messages Book 3, p. 460.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In many of her manuscripts as they come from her hand quotation marks are used.

In some features of this work, information was given in detail. Regarding some features of the revelation, such as the features of prophetic chronology, as regards the ministration in the sanctuary and the changes that took place in 1844, the matter was presented to her many times and in detail many times, and this enabled her to speak very clearly and very positively regarding the foundation pillars of our faith."},{"refcode_short":"3SM 462.3","refcode_long":"Selected Messages Book 3, p. 462.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In some of the historical matters such as are brought out in Patriarchs and Prophets and in Acts of the Apostles, and in Great Controversy, the main outlines were made very clear and plain to her, and when she came to write up these topics, she was left to study the Bible and history to get dates and geographical relations and to perfect her description of details."},{"refcode_short":"3SM 462.4","refcode_long":"Selected Messages Book 3, p. 462.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Ellen White was a rapid reader and had a very retentive memory.
