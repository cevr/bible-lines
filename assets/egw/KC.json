Those who desired to forget their Creator, and to cast off the restraint of His law, decided to separate from the worshipers of God. Accordingly they journeyed to the plain of Shinar, on the banks of the river Euphrates. Here they decided to build a city, and in it a tower reaching unto heaven—so high that no flood could rise to the top, so massive that nothing could sweep it away. Thus they hoped to make themselves independent of God."},{"refcode_short":"KC 1.2","refcode_long":"The Kress Collection, p. 1.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"But among the men of Babel there were living some God-fearing men who had been deceived by the pretensions of the ungodly, and drawn into their wicked schemes. These men would not join this confederacy to thwart the purposes of God. They refused to be deceived by the wonderful representations and the grand outlook. For the sake of these faithful ones, the Lord delayed His judgments, and gave the people time to reveal their true character. They heeded not the counsel of the Lord, but carried out their own purposes. The great majority were fully united in their heaven-daring undertaking.

The dwellers on the plains of Shinar established their kingdom for self-exaltation, and not for the glory of God. Had they succeeded, a mighty power would have borne away, banishing righteousness, and inaugurating a new religion. The mixture of certain religious ideas with a mass of erroneous theories would have resulted in closing the door of peace, happiness, and security. These suppositions, erroneous theories, carried out and perfected, would have banished a knowledge of the law of Jehovah from the minds of men, who would not think it necessary to obey the divine statutes. These statutes, which are holy, just, and good, would have been ignored. Determined men, inspired by the first great rebel, would have urged on by him, and would have permitted nothing to interfere with their plans, or to stop them in their evil course. In the place of the divine precepts they would have substituted laws framed in accordance with the desires of their selfish hearts in order that they might carry out their purposes."},{"refcode_short":"KC 1.4","refcode_long":"The Kress Collection, p. 1.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"But God never leaves the world without witnesses for Him.

God bears long with the perversity of men, giving them ample opportunity for repentance; but He marks all their devices to resist the authority of His just and holy law.

Thus they can give great satisfaction to the heavenly universe. If each volunteer in the army of the Lord will do his best, God will do the rest. They are to call nothing their own. When striving for the victory they are to strive lawfully. The word is to be their teacher. Unholy ambition will not advance them, for God only can give true wisdom and understanding; but He will not work with Satan. If envy and unholy ambition are cherished, if they wrestle for the victory to obtain human glory, the mind will be filled with confusion. Do your best advance as fast as possible to reach a high standard in spiritual knowledge. Sink self in Jesus Christ, and aim ever to glorify His name. Bear in mind that talent, learning, position, wealth, and influence, are the gifts from God; therefore they should be consecrated to Him. Seek to obtain an education that will qualify you to be wise stewards of the manifold grace of Christ Jesus, servants under Christ to do His bidding."},{"refcode_short":"KC 67.2","refcode_long":"The Kress Collection, p. 67.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Let all students seek to take as broad a view as possible of their obligations to God.

Who has kept you calm and self-possessed in the crisis, giving you quick, sharp discernment, clear eyesight, steady nerves, and skillful precision? The Lord Jesus has sent His angel to your side, to tell you what to do. A hand has been laid upon your hand. Jesus, and not you, has guided the movements of your hand. At times you have realized this, and a wonderful calmness has come over you. You dared not hurry, and yet you worked rapidly, knowing that there was not a second to waste. The Lord has greatly blessed you. Others who knew not of the presiding Presence working with you, gave you all the glory. Eminent physicians have witnessed your operations and praised your skill. This has been pleasant to you. You have not always been able to endure the seeing of the Invisible by faith. You have been under divine guidance. You have been greatly honored by God, that His name, and not yours, should be magnified. But you have had a great desire to distinguish yourself; you have not placed your entire dependence upon God. You have not been willing to heed the counsel of the Lord's servants. With your own brain, you have planned many things. The Lord would have you respect the gospel ministry. At the very time you needed discerning eyes, that you might see, not only one side of the work, but all sides, you chose for counsellors, men under the reproof of God, as did Elder Olsen. If they would second your propositions, you would link up with them, to start enterprises that the Lord placed no burden on you to start."},{"refcode_short":"KC 92.2","refcode_long":"The Kress Collection, p. 92.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The Lord gave you your work, not to be done in a rush, but in a calm, considerate manner.

Such ones can be transformed in character; but few ever are. Many make a superficial change in their habits and practices, and then suppose that they are Christians. They are received into church fellowship; but they are a great trouble and a great care. Through them, Satan tries to sow in the church the seeds of jealousy, dishonesty, criticism, and accusing. Thus he tries to corrupt the other members of the church. The same disposition that mastered the man from childhood, led him to break away from all restraint, and brought him into the place where he was found. He is reported to be rescued. But time shows that the work done for him did not make him a submissive child of God. Resentful feelings rise at every supposed slight. He cherishes bitterness, wrath, malice. By his words and spirit, he shows that he has not been born again. His tendencies are downward, tending to sensuality. He is untrustworthy, unthankful, and unholy.

In this work, whether we are rich or poor, we are called upon to wear Christ's yoke, and learn of him to be meek and lowly in heart. Some more may especially be given the work of setting forth Christ from the pulpit, opening the oracles of God to the churches.

Altogether too little of this work is done. Personal labor is greatly needed. Many, many souls might be saved if those who claim to be followers of Christ would work as Christ worked living not to please self, but to glorify God, acting as missionaries, showing genuine love for the Master by making every possible use of their entrusted talents. From the very nature of work in Christ's lines, those who do it will lose sight of self. We are called upon to love souls as Christ loved them, to feel a travail of soul that sinners shall be converted. Present the matchless love of Christ. Hide self out of sight. Oh, what care should be taken by all who claim to be Christians that they do not call their passions and self-importance religion. By showing vanity, by longing for distinction, many hide the person of Christ, and expose themselves to view. There is such self-importance in their own ideas and way, and they cherish such a pleasing sense of their smartness, that the Lord cannot bestow his Holy Spirit upon them. If he did, they would misinterpret it, and exalt themselves still higher because of it. Their self pleasing ideas are a great hindrance to the advancement of the work. Whatever part they act self is the main picture presented. Their own zeal and devotion is thought to be the great power of truth. Unaware to themselves, all such are unfaithful stewards.

Therefore, if good, faithful workers can be secured to take their place in Wahroonga, and if their minds are drawn toward Washington to work, secure their transfer if possible. I believe that the Lord has been working to bring about changes that would open the way for Dr. Kress to come to Washington.

At last the board passed a resolution requesting me to place the matter fully before Sister White.

Some of the very best qualified men in our institutions should be chosen for this work. To some it may seem unwise to take men qualified for the position of head physician and put them to labor in the cities and choose men to take their places in the institution; but we need to take a broader view of the work, and to consider that the Lord is calling for a special line of work to be done in the cities,—a work which requires the efforts of men of clear perception and who in the power of the Holy Spirit can present before large congregations the principles of health reform. The presenting of Bible principles by intelligent physicians will have great weight with many people. The efficiency and power of one who can combine in his influence the work of a physician and of the gospel minister who can estimate? This work commends itself to the good judgment of the people.

The daily papers gave liberal space, devoting in some instances almost a full page in writing “Kress gatherings.” Later a letter came from Sister White in which she said: “The work you have been doing in the city is meeting Heaven's approval. This experience is to be a lesson to others besides Elder Starr and Dr. Kress. You have demonstrated that if our physicians and our ministers would work together in the presentation of truth to the people, more can be reached than could be influenced by the ministers laboring alone. I trust that your example in this respect may be followed by other physicians. I do not urge that you and your wife separate entirely from the Sanitarium.
