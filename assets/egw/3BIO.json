This volume of the biography portrays the lonely years in her experience. If she had not had to deliver messages of correction, reproof, or rebuke; if the testimony she was called upon to bear had been all of praise and approbation; if she had been able to lean heavily upon human beings to guide her in fulfilling her call, she would not have experienced the periods of loneliness pictured in these pages."},{"refcode_short":"3BIO 9.3","refcode_long":"Ellen G.

The last years of James White's life were marked by notable achievements in building the church and its institutions in spite of periods impaired by illness.

Some of these personnel were new in the doctrine and had limited managerial experience. Ellen White's role as the messenger of the Lord in such circumstances was complicated and involved. This, together with the fact that many members and leaders resisted reproof, correction, and guidance, cast upon her a burden that at times was almost too heavy to bear. This was particularly true as the church passed through the crises related to the General Conference session at Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1888."},{"refcode_short":"3BIO 10.4","refcode_long":"Ellen G.

The telegraph now speeded communications, and that wonder, the telephone, would soon obliterate distances. Quill pens gave way to pencils and the fountain pen. The invention of the typewriter gave promise of a revolution in literary work, but for James and Ellen White, this was yet almost a decade away.

It would seem that these revolved somewhat around the growing tendency on the part of James to feel that he should be privileged to dominate Ellen's work. His keen insight and firm hand in the leadership of the church had saved it many a tragedy, and his strong drive had pushed forward a work that could easily have faltered. But as he advanced in years he was inclined to become demanding and somewhat dictatorial. Through the years Ellen had cherished his counsel, and she much appreciated his assistance in preparing materials for the press.

This gave the Whites time to assist in the two late camp meetings in Kansas, one near Topeka and the other some 150 miles south, close to Oswego.

When on Friday evening Dr. Kellogg advised her that James White was failing fast, she had gotten up from her sickbed. Though seeming to be recovering, she was still very ill. She stayed with James through the night and all the next day till his death. Then she almost collapsed. Dr. Kellogg sensed her danger, although she did not. That night he appointed two attendants, and he himself slept close by with clothes on, so that he might be instantly at her side if needed. He charged the two women helpers, Mary Chinnock and Emma Webber: “Watch the pulse and call me at any change.” Not sensing her peril and always thoughtful of others, Ellen White told the two women that they could sleep.

These were printed in a pamphlet of eighty-four pages, which was given the title Testimony for the Battle Creek Church. Because of its twenty-one-page central article, the pamphlet is at times referred to as “An Important Testimony.” It carries an introduction addressed “To the Reader,” stating, “The following pages contain instruction, warning, and admonition of special importance to the Battle Creek Church at the present crisis.” The promise was made that extracts would be published in the forthcoming Testimony, No. 31, then in preparation.

She found it hard to realize that she was in Europe and had already labored in England, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, and now was on her way to Italy (Historical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists, 226). Fortunately, the fog had disappeared and the sun was out in all its glory. Their journey took them through “wild and magnificent scenery.” As they skirted Lake Lucerne with its swans and flocks of half-tamed birds, she recognized that the terrain was “intimately associated with those historical traditions connected with William Tell, the so-called liberator of Switzerland from the Austrian yoke” (Ibid., 227). Her eyes feasted on the intricacies of the tunnels and bridges of the St. Gotthard pass, and as she traveled she informed herself of the building of the railroad that tunneled through the Alps.

She exclaimed, “I long for rest, for quietude and to get out the ‘Life of Christ.”’— MS 29 1891. In fact, in anticipation of a concerted program of writing, she had purchased a lot in Petoskey, in the resort area on Lake Michigan, where she had spent two months the summer before. She was having a home built there, where she and her staff could hide away and work. But meetings the brethren wished her to attend would involve several weeks. The last of these were at Grand Rapids, which she would attend en route to Petoskey. In her restlessness she wrote:"},{"refcode_short":"3BIO 490.2","refcode_long":"Ellen G.

There have been times when circumstances seemed very perplexing; when the way to harmonize apparently conflicting views did not at once appear. And under what have seemed, for the time, strong provocations to withdraw from the work, I\nhave canvassed the question how far this could reasonably be done, or how much of this work could consistently be surrendered. I have pondered the questions whether this point was not inconsistent, or that absurd, or the other out of harmony with reason and revelation; and whether this feature ought not to be readjusted, or the other set aside entirely. All this ground I have gone over as thoroughly as anyone of no more ability than myself could go, and as candidly as anyone in as much darkness as I was in would be likely to maintain.

It is evident, also, that this work before its close must present the fulfillment of the prophecy of Joel, and some prophecies of the book of revelation. And to whatever degree I may have persuaded myself that this cause might have been so far developed without this feature which we call the gift of prophecy, it was only to look for something of the kind to appear in the future; for without this, it would lack one of the tests of being the work of the last generation."},{"refcode_short":"3BIO 494.2","refcode_long":"Ellen G.

It has seemed to me the better way to consider the question in all its bearings, note the effects which would be produced, take in the consequences, and not make a move till one was prepared to accept the results which it was foreseen would probably or inevitably follow. Upon this principle I have tried to act. And I have never seen the time when I was willing to accept the results of a denial of the position and calling of sister White in connection with this cause, and hence have never seen the time when I have said by word of mouth, or come to a decision in my own heart, that her visions were not the operation of the spirit of God."},{"refcode_short":"3BIO 495.1","refcode_long":"Ellen G.

I do not anticipate any severer tests in time to come than have already been met and surmounted.

I do not, of course, presume to say what further experiences and discipline may be necessary to test the sincerity of my profession and the strength of my devotion to what I believe to be the cause of God.
