He who does not abhor himself can not understand the meaning of redemption. To be redeemed means to cease from sin. No heart that is stirred to rebellion against the law of God has any union with Christ, who died to vindicate the law and exalt it before all nations, tongues, and peoples. Pharisaic self-complacency and bold assumptions of holiness are abundant. There are many who do not see themselves in the light of the law of God. They do not loathe selfishness; therefore they are selfish. Their souls are spotted and defiled. Yet with sin-stained lips they say, “I am holy. Jesus teaches me that the law of God is a yoke of bondage.

His purpose was to establish a kingdom which would be governed by his own laws, and carried on with his own resources, independent of God; and so well did he succeed that when Christ came to the world to establish a kingdom, he looked upon the governments of men, and said, “Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God?” Nothing in civil society afforded him a comparison.

When we see men firm in principle, fearless in duty, zealous in the cause of God, gentle and tender, patient toward all, ready to forgive, manifesting love for souls for whom Christ died, we know they have “the wisdom from above,” that is “first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated; full of mercy and good fruits.” And the Lord can bless their labors as he cannot those of the self-centered and self-sufficient."},{"refcode_short":"SW June 30,  1908, par. 4","refcode_long":"The Watchman June 30,  1908, paragraph 4","content":"All the followers of Jesus have their work to do, in their families, in their neighborhoods, in the towns and cities where they live.

The unbelieving may appear indifferent and careless; yet God impresses and convicts their hearts that there is a reality in the truth.

To those who have been listening only to fables, God will give an opportunity to hear the sure word of prophecy, whereunto they will do well to take heed, as unto a light that shines in a dark place.

He could appreciate that ability of the Lord which might work for the advancement of his own temporal affairs; but spiritual truths had taken no hold on his mind and heart. The gaining of the inheritance was his absorbing theme. Jesus, the King of glory, who was rich, yet for our sake became poor, was opening to him the treasures of divine love. The Holy Spirit was pleading with him to become an heir of the inheritance that is “incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away.” He had seen evidence of the power of Christ. Now the opportunity was his to speak to the great Teacher, to express the desire uppermost in his heart. But, like the man with the muck-rake in Bunyan's allegory, his eyes were fixed on the earth.

Their work was to persuade men to be reconciled to God. In this work lay their power to bless humanity. The only remedy for the sins and sorrows of men is Christ. The gospel of his grace alone can cure the evils that curse society. The injustice of the rich toward the poor, the hatred of the poor toward the rich, alike have their root in selfishness, and this can be eradicated only through submission to Christ. He alone, for the selfish heart of sin gives the new heart of love. Let the servants of Christ preach the gospel with the Spirit sent down from heaven, and work as he did for the benefit of men.

Minds that have been amused and abused by reading fiction may in nature have an open book, and read truth in the works of God around them. All may find themes for study in the simple leaf of the forest tree, the spires of grass covering the earth with their green, velvet carpet, the plants and flowers, the stately trees of the forest, the lofty mountains, the granite rocks, the restless ocean, the precious gems of light, studding the heavens to make the night beautiful, the exhaustless riches of the sunlight, the solemn glories of the moon, the winter's cold, the summer's heat, the changing, recurrent seasons in perfect order and harmony, controlled by infinite power; here are subjects which call for deep thought, for the stretch of the imagination."},{"refcode_short":"SW November 3,  1908, par. 2","refcode_long":"The Watchman November 3,  1908, paragraph 2","content":"If the frivolous and pleasure-seeking will allow their minds to dwell upon the real and true, the heart cannot but be filled with reverence, and they will adore the God of nature.

The book of nature is a great lesson-book, which in connection with the Scriptures we are to use in teaching others of his character, and guiding lost sheep back to the fold of God. As the works of God are studied, the Holy Spirit flashes conviction into the mind. It is not the conviction that logical reasoning produces; but unless the mind has become too dark to know God, the eye too dim to see him, the ear too dull to hear his voice, a deeper meaning is grasped, and the sublime, spiritual truths of the written Word are impressed on the heart."},{"refcode_short":"SW November 3,  1908, par. 5","refcode_long":"The Watchman November 3,  1908, paragraph 5","content":"In these lessons direct from nature, there is a simplicity that makes them of the highest value.

Too often the minds of students are occupied with men's theories and speculations, falsely called science and philosophy. They need to be brought into close contact with nature. Let them be taught to see the harmony of the natural with the spiritual. Let everything which their eyes see or their hands handle be made a lesson in character-building.

He shows us how he estimates true beauty. The ornament of a meek and quiet spirit is in his sight of great price. Shall we not seek earnestly to gain that which God estimates as more valuable than costly dress, or pearls, or gold? The inward adorning, the grace of meekness, a spirit in harmony with the heavenly angels, will not lessen true dignity of character, or make us less lovely here in this world. The Redeemer has warned us against the pride of life, but not against its grace and natural beauty. He pointed to the glowing beauty of the flowers of the field, and said, “Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin; and yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.” Here he shows that, even though persons may toil with weariness to make themselves objects of admiration, that which they value so highly will not bear comparison with the flowers of the field."},{"refcode_short":"SW November 3,  1908, par. 9","refcode_long":"The Watchman November 3,  1908, paragraph 9","content":"In the growth and development of nature, learn the principles of Christ's kingdom.

Such an education will restore the image of God in the soul.

He fulfils his promises in far greater measure than we expect to receive help."},{"refcode_short":"SW May 1,  1914, par. 7","refcode_long":"The Watchman May 1,  1914, paragraph 7","content":"So long as Satan continues to live, we shall have perplexity; and if we choose to follow the counsel of the enemy, we shall have constant difficulty; but if we refuse to yield to satanic influences, choosing rather to lay hold on God and on the promises of his Word, we shall be able to help and strengthen and uphold one another. Thus we shall bring into the work with which we are connected a spirit of courage. Never are we to utter a word that would arouse doubt or fear, or that would cast shadows over the minds of others. I am determined not to permit myself to speak discouraging words; and when I hear criticism and complaint, or an expression of doubt and fear, I know that he who thus speaks has his eyes turned away from the Saviour. I know every such person does not appreciate him who at infinite sacrifice left the royal courts and came down into the world that was lost, and lived among the children of men in order that he might speak words of hope and good cheer to the discouraged and desponding."},{"refcode_short":"SW May 1,  1914, par. 8","refcode_long":"The Watchman May 1,  1914, paragraph 8","content":"Wherever we are, we are under obligation as disciples of our Lord and Master, to anchor our faith in the promises of God. Individually we are to believe. We are not to cast about for a possible doubt, or imagine that sometime we may have to stand beneath the shadow of a cloud that seems to be gathering. We are chosen of God to be his children. We have been bought with an infinite price, and we have no occasion for placing the suggestions of the enemy before the assurances of the Lord Jesus Christ."}]
