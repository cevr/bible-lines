Ten thousand times ten thousand were assembled before a large throne, upon which was seated a person of majestic appearance. Several books were before him, and upon the covers of each was written in letters of gold, which seemed like a burning flame of fire, “Ledger of Heaven.” One of these books containing the names of those who claimed to believe the truth was then opened. Immediately I lost sight of the countless millions about the throne, and only those who were professedly children of the light and of the truth engaged my attention. As these persons were named, one by one, and their good deeds mentioned, their countenances would light up with a holy joy that was reflected in every direction. But this did not seem to rest upon my mind with the greatest force."},{"refcode_short":"T29 3.3","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 29, p. 3.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Another book was opened, wherein were recorded the sins of those who professed the truth. Under the general heading of selfishness came every other sin. There were also headings over every column, and underneath these, opposite each name, were recorded in their respective columns the lesser sins. Under covetousness came falsehood, theft, robbery, fraud, and avariciousness; under ambition came pride and extravagance; jealousy stood at the head of malice, envy, hatred; and intemperance headed a long list of fearful crimes, such as lasciviousness, adultery, indulgence of animal passions, etc. As I beheld, I was filled with inexpressible anguish, and exclaimed, Who can be saved? who will stand justified before God? whose robes are spotless? who are faultless in the sight of a pure and holy God?"},{"refcode_short":"T29 4.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 29, p. 4.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"As the Holy One upon the throne slowly turned the leaves of the Ledger, and his eyes rested for a moment upon individuals, his glance seemed to burn into their very souls, and at the same moment every word and action of their lives passed before their minds as clearly as if traced before their vision in letters of fire. Trembling seized them, and their faces turned pale. Their first appearance when around the throne was that of careless indifference. But how changed their appearance now! The feeling of security is gone, and in its place is a nameless terror. A dread is upon every soul lest he shall be found among those who are wanting. Every eye is riveted upon the face of the One upon the throne; and as his solemn, searching eye sweeps over that company, there is a quaking of heart, for they are self-condemned without one word being uttered. In anguish of soul each declares his own guilt, and with terrible vividness sees that by sinning he has thrown away the precious boon of eternal life."},{"refcode_short":"T29 5.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 29, p. 5.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"One class were registered as cumberers of the ground. As the piercing eye of the Judge vested upon these, their sins of neglect were distinctly revealed. With pale and quivering lips they acknowledged that they had been traitors to their holy trust. They had had warnings and privileges, but they had not heeded nor improved them. They now see that they presumed too much upon the mercy of God. True, they had not such confessions to make as had the vile and basely corrupt; but like the fig-tree they were cursed because they bore no fruit, because they had not put to use the talents intrusted to them."},{"refcode_short":"T29 5.2","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 29, p. 5.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"This class had made themselves supreme, laboring only for selfish interests. They were not rich toward God, not having responded to his claims upon them. Although professing to be servants of Jesus Christ, they brought no souls to him. Had the cause of God been dependent on their efforts, it would have languished; for they not only withheld the means lent them of God, but they withheld themselves. But these now see and feel that in occupying an irresponsible position in reference to the work and cause of God, they have placed themselves on the left hand. They had opportunity, but would not do the work that they could and should have done."},{"refcode_short":"T29 5.3","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 29, p. 5.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The names of all who professed the truth were mentioned. Some were reproved for their unbelief, others for having been slothful servants. They allowed others to do the work in the Master's vineyard, and to bear the heaviest responsibilities, while they were selfishly serving their own temporal interests. By cultivating the abilities God had given them, they could have been reliable burden-bearers, working for the interest of the Master. Said the Judge, All will be justified by their faith, and judged by their works. How vividly then appeared their neglect, and how wise the arrangement of God in giving to every man a work to do to promote the cause and save his fellow-men. Each was to demonstrate a living faith in his family and in his neighborhood, by showing kindness to the poor, sympathizing with the afflicted, engaging in missionary labor, and by aiding the cause of God with his means. But like Meroz, the curse of God rested upon them for what they did not do. They loved that work which would bring the greatest profit in this life; and opposite their names in the Ledger devoted to good works there was a mournful blank."},{"refcode_short":"T29 6.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 29, p. 6.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The words spoken to these were most solemn: You are weighed in the balances, and found wanting. You have neglected spiritual responsibilities because of busy activity in temporal matters, while your very position of trust made it necessary that you should have more than human wisdom and greater than finite judgment.

God sent his Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that through him it might be saved. My love for you has been more self-denying than a mother's love. It was that I might blot out your dark record of iniquity, and put the cup of salvation to your lips, that I suffered the death of the cross, bearing the weight and curse of your guilt. The pangs of death, and the horrors of the darkness of the tomb, I endured that I might conquer him who had the power of death, unbar the prison-house, and open for you the gates of life. I submitted to shame and agony because I loved you with an infinite love, and would bring back my wayward, wandering sheep to the paradise of God, to the tree of life. That life of bliss which I purchased for you at such a cost, you have disregarded. Shame, reproach, and ignominy, such as your Master bore for you, you have shunned. The privileges he died to bring within your reach have not been appreciated. You would not be partaker of his sufferings, and you cannot now be partaker with him of his glory. Thou were uttered these solemn words: “He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he that is holy, let him be holy still.” The book then closed, and the mantle fell from the person on the throne, revealing the terrible glory of the Son of God."},{"refcode_short":"T29 7.2","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 29, p. 7.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The scene then passed away, and I found myself still upon the earth, inexpressibly grateful that the day of God had not yet come, and that precious probationary time was still granted us in which to prepare for eternity."},{"refcode_short":"T29 8","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 29, p. 8 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Our Publications."},{"refcode_short":"T29 8.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 29, p. 8.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Some things of grave importance have not been receiving due attention at our Offices of publication.

And those of our people who have no special burden of the various branches of the work at Battle Creek, and at Oakland, do not become informed in regard to the wants of the cause, and the capital required to keep the business moving. They do not understand the liability to losses, and the expense every day occurring to such institutions. They seem to think that everything moves off without much care or outlay of means, and therefore they will urge the necessity of the lowest figures on our publications, thus leaving scarcely any margin. And after the prices have been reduced to almost ruinous figures, they manifest but a feeble interest in increasing the sales of the very books on which they have asked such low prices. The object gained, their burden ceases, when they ought to have an earnest interest and a real care to press the sale of the publications, thereby sowing the seeds of truth, and bringing means into the Offices to invest in other publications."},{"refcode_short":"T29 9.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 29, p. 9.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"There has been, on the part of ministers, a very great neglect of duty in not interesting the churches in the localities where they labor, in regard to this matter. When once the prices of books are reduced, it is a very difficult matter to get them again upon a paying basis, as men of narrow minds will cry speculation, not discerning that no one man is benefited, and that God's instrumentalities must not be crippled for want of capital.

While there has been a quick foresight to discern the necessity of laying out means in facilities to multiply books and tracts, plans to bring back the means invested, so as to reproduce other publications, have been neglected. The power of the press with all its advantages is in their hands, and they can use it to the very best account, or they can be half asleep, and through inaction, lose the advantages which they might gain. They can extend the light, by judicious calculation, in the sale of books and pamphlets.

Living preachers are few. There is only one where there should be a hundred. Many are making a great mistake in not putting their talents to use in seeking to save the souls of their fellow-men. Hundreds of men should be engaged in carrying the light all through our cities, villages, and towns. The public mind must be agitated. God says, Let light be sent out into all parts of the field.

In all parts of the field canvassers should be selected, not from the floating element in society, not from men and women who are good for nothing else, and have made a success of nothing; but they should be persons of good address, of tact, keen foresight and ability. Such are needed to make a success as colporteurs, canvassers, and agents. Men suited to this work undertake it; but some injudicious minister will flatter them that their gift should be employed in the desk instead of simply working as colporteurs. Thus the work of the colporteur is belittled. They are influenced to get a license to preach, and the very ones who might have been trained to make good missionaries to visit families at their homes, and talk and pray with them, are caught up to make poor ministers, and the field where so much labor is needed and where so much good might be accomplished for the cause, is neglected.

Skepticism and infidelity are increasing everywhere. Light, so precious, coming from the throne of God, is hid under a bushel. God will make his people responsible for this neglect.

Men should be at work who are willing to be taught as to the best way of approaching individuals and families.

There are many who are seeking for light in the darkness. If our papers, tracts, and books, expressing the truth in plain Bible language, could be widely circulated, many would find that they are just what they want.

They have come in contact with them, but have never warned them, never prayed with or for them, and never made earnest efforts to present the truth to them. I was shown that there has been a wonderful negligence on this point. Ministers are not doing one-half what they might do to educate the people for whom they labor upon all points of truth and duty; and, as a consequence, the people are spiritless and inactive. The stake and scaffold are not appointed for this time to test the people of God, and for this very reason the love of many has waxed cold. When trials arise, grace is proportioned for the emergency.

While Christ is the minister in the sanctuary above, he is also, through his delegates, the minister of his church on earth. He speaks to the people through chosen men, and carries forward his work through them, as when, in the days of his humiliation, he moved visibly upon the earth. Although centuries have passed, the lapse of time has not changed his parting promise to his disciples, “Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.” From Christ's ascension to the present day, men ordained of God, deriving their authority from him, have become teachers of the faith. Christ, the True Shepherd, superintends his work through the instrumentality of these under-shepherds. Thus the position of those who labor in word and doctrine becomes very important.

But in many discourses the cross of Christ is not presented before the people. Some may be listening to the last sermon they will ever hear. And some will never again be situated where they can have the chain of truth brought before them and a practical application made of it to their hearts. That golden opportunity lost, is lost forever.

Many ministers think that it is not necessary to preach repentance and faith, with a heart all subdued by the love of God; they take it for granted that their hearers are perfectly acquainted with the gospel, and that matters of a different nature must be presented in order to hold their attention.

When the law of God is set before the sinner, showing him the depth of his sins, he should then be pointed to the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.

Frequently, when efforts are made to introduce the truth into new fields, the labor is almost entirely theoretical. The people are unsettled. They see the force of truth, and are anxious to obtain a sure foundation. As their feelings are softened, then is the time, above all others, to urge the religion of Christ home upon the conscience; but too often the course of lectures has been allowed to close without that work being done for the people which they needed. That effort was too much like the offering of Cain; it had not the sacrificial blood to make it acceptable to God.

They do not have a living connection with God. Many souls decide in favor of the truth, from the weight of evidence, without being converted. Practical discourses were not given in connection with the doctrinal, that as the hearers should see the beautiful chain of truth they might fall in love with its Author, and be sanctified through obedience. The minister's work is not done until he has urged home upon his hearers the necessity of change of character in accordance with the pure principles of the truth which they have received."},{"refcode_short":"T29 19.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 29, p. 19.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"A formal religion is to be dreaded; for in it is no Saviour.

Christ and his Father were one; in all the Father's requirements Christ cheerfully acquiesced. He had the mind of God. The Redeemer was the perfect pattern. Jehovah was manifested in him. Heaven was enshrined in humanity, and humanity inclosed in the bosom of Infinite Love. If ministers will in meekness sit at the feet of Jesus, they will soon obtain right views of God's character, and will be able to teach others also. Some enter the ministry without deep love to God or to their fellow-men.

It should be urged upon them again and again that no one will be able to resist temptation, to answer the purpose of God, and live the life of a Christian, unless he shall take up his work, be it great or small, and do that work with conscientious fidelity. There is something for all to do besides going to church, and listening to the word of God. They must practice the truth heard, carrying its principles into their every-day life.

Let the kindness and courtesy of the minister be seen in his treatment of children. He should ever bear in mind that they are miniature men and women, younger members of the Lord's family. These may be very near and dear to the Master, and, if properly instructed and disciplined, will do service for him, even in their youth. Christ is grieved with every harsh, severe, and inconsiderate word spoken to children.

Those who have been brought from error and darkness to truth and light have great changes to make, and unless the necessity of thorough reform is pressed home upon the conscience, they will be like the man who looked in the mirror, the law of God, and discovered the defects in his moral character, but went away and forgot what manner of man he was.

The proper labor and instruction will result in bringing into working order those men and women whose characters are strong, and their convictions so firm that nothing of a selfish character is permitted to hinder them in their work, to lessen their faith, or deter them from duty. If the minister has properly instructed those under his care, when he leaves for other fields of labor, the work left will not ravel out, for it is bound off so firmly that it is secure. Unless those who receive the truth are thoroughly converted, and there is a radical change in their life and character, the soul is not riveted to the eternal Rock; and after the labor of the minister ceases, and the novelty is gone, the impression soon wears away, the truth loses its power to charm, and they exert no holier influence, and are no better for their profession of the truth."},{"refcode_short":"T29 23.2","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 29, p. 23.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I am astonished, that with the examples before us of what man may be, and what he may do, we are not stimulated to greater exertion to emulate the good works of the righteous.

They should not be so pressed with study as to neglect the culture of the manners; and above all, they should let nothing interfere with their seasons of prayer, which bring them in connection with Jesus Christ, the best teacher the world has ever known. In no case should they deprive themselves of religious privileges. Many students have made their studies the first great object, and have neglected prayer, and absented themselves from the Sabbath-school and the prayer-meeting; and from neglect of religious duties they have returned to their homes backslidden from God. A most important part of their education has been neglected. That which lies at the foundation of all true knowledge should not have been made a secondary consideration. “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” “Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness” This must not be made last, but first.

They may be able to interest the people, and engage in controversy, while they are by no means men of thought, who will improve their ability and enlarge their capacities. We have a dwarfed and defective ministry. Unless Christ shall abide in the men who preach the truth, they will lower the moral and religious standard wherever they are tolerated. One example is given them, even Christ. “All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.” In the Bible we have the unerring counsel of God. Its teachings practically carried out will fit men for any position of duty. It is the voice of God speaking every day to the soul. How carefully should the young study the word of God, and treasure up its sentiments in the heart, that its precepts may be made to govern the whole conduct. Our young ministers, and those who have been some time preaching, show a marked deficiency in their understanding of the Scriptures. The work of the Holy Spirit is to enlighten the darkened understanding, to melt the selfish, stony heart, to subdue the rebellious transgressor, and save him from the corrupting influences of the world. The prayer of Christ for his disciples was, “Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth.” The sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, pierces the heart of the sinner, and cuts it in pieces. When the theory of the truth is repeated without its sacred influence being felt upon the soul of the speaker, it has no force upon the hearers, but is rejected as error, the speaker making himself responsible for the loss of souls.

Moses was directed of God to obtain an experience in care-taking, in thoughtfulness, in tender solicitude for his flock, that he might as a faithful shepherd be ready when God should call him to take charge of his people. A similar experience is essential for those who engage in the great work of preaching the truth. In order to lead souls to the life-giving fountain, the preacher must first drink at the fountain himself. He must see the infinite sacrifice of the Son of God to save fallen men, and his own soul must be imbued with the spirit of undying love. If God appoints us hard labor to perform, we must do it without a murmur. If the path be difficult and dangerous, it is God's plan to have us follow in meekness, and cry unto him for strength. A lesson is to be learned from the experience of some of our ministers who have known nothing comparatively of difficulties, of trials, yet ever look upon themselves as martyrs. They have yet to learn to accept the way of God's choosing, with thankfulness, remembering the Author of our salvation. The work of the minister should be pursued with an earnestness, energy, and zeal, as much greater than that put forth in business transactions as the labor is more sacred and the result more momentous. Each day's work should tell in the eternal records as “well done;” so that if no other day should be granted in which to labor, the work will be thoroughly finished. Our ministers, young men especially, should realize the work of preparation necessary to fit them for their solemn work, and to prepare them for the society of pure angels.

They are novices in the truth, and dwarfs in religious experience. The greatest victories which are gained to this cause are not labored argument, ample facilities, abundance of influence, and plenty of means; but they are those victories which are gained in the audience chamber with God, when earnest, agonizing faith lays hold upon the mighty arm of power. When Jacob found himself utterly prostrate and in a helpless condition, he poured out his soul in an agony of earnestness to God. The angel of God pleads to be released; but Jacob will not let go his hold.

One such person will inspire more skepticism in minds than several will be able to counteract, do the best they can.

Self-denial is to do good to others where inclination would lead you to serve and please yourself. Although your fellow-men may never appreciate your efforts, or give you credit for the same, you are to work on."},{"refcode_short":"T29 191.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 29, p. 191.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Search carefully and see whether the truth which you have accepted has, with you, become a firm principle. Do you take Christ with you when you leave the closet of prayer? Does your religion stand guard at the door of your lips? Is your heart drawn out in sympathy and love for others outside of your own family? Are you diligently seeking a clearer understanding of scriptural truth that you may let your light shine forth to others? These questions you may answer to your own souls. Let your speech be seasoned with grace, and your demeanor show Christian elevation."},{"refcode_short":"T29 191.2","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 29, p. 191.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"A new year has commenced. What has been the record of the past year in your Christian life? How stands your record in Heaven? I entreat of you to make an unreserved surrender to God. Have your hearts been divided? Give them wholly to the Lord now. Make a different life history the coming year from the one of the past. Humble your souls before God. “Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to them that love him.” Put away all pretense and affectation. Act your simple, natural self. Be truthful in every thought, and word, and deed, and “in all lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.” Ever remember that moral nature needs to be braced with constant watchfulness and prayer. As long as you look to Christ, you are safe, but the moment you think of your sacrifices and your difficulties, and begin to sympathize with and pet yourself you lose your trust in God and are in great peril,"},{"refcode_short":"T29 192.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 29, p. 192.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Many limit the divine Providence, and divorce mercy and love from his character. They urge that the greatness and majesty of God would forbid his interesting himself in the concerns of the weakest of his creatures. “Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not, therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.”"},{"refcode_short":"T29 192.2","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 29, p. 192.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"It is difficult for human beings to give attention to the lesser matters of life while the mind is engaged in business of vast importance. But should not this union exist? Man formed in the image of his Maker should unite the larger responsibilities with the smaller. He may be engrossed with occupations of overwhelming importance, and neglect the instruction which his children need. These duties may be looked upon as the lesser duties of life, when they in reality lie at the very foundation of society. Happiness of families and churches depends upon home influences. Eternal interests depend upon the proper discharge of the duties of this life. The world is not so much in need of great minds, as of good men who will be a blessing in their homes."}]
