A most solemn responsibility rests upon them. The home of every Christian should be a little church, a representation of the heavenly home, from which others may learn what a family can become in this world through obedience to God's word. Heaven is much nearer to the earth than many realize. The angels of God are ascending and descending the ladder of shining brightness that Jacob saw.

It is our privilege, through faith, to have the mind of Christ, and to abide in Him. I especially beseech mothers to remember that it is their privilege to have the mind of Christ. Never lose control of your temper. You cannot afford to do this; for thus you would sow in the hearts of your children seed that, sooner or later, would produce the fruits of unrighteousness. Such seed-sowing is represented as laying wood, hay, and stubble upon the foundation stone. How much better it is to use gold, silver, and precious stones in the character-building, by being compassionate, considerate, charitable, and long-suffering in every word and deed! When you have learned to control yourself, it will be easy for you to bind your children to you with the silken cord of love. This is true religion. Thus you give a true representation of Christ.

Touch the hand a little severely, if necessary. When he reaches after the forbidden object again, say, “No, no! No, no! Mustn't touch! Mustn't touch!” Time and again I have seen this method followed successfully in dealing with little children who wanted to grasp everything that their hands could handle, while sitting at the dining-room table. Such children should be restrained. Tell them that there are things which they must not touch.

By indiscretion you can arouse the very worst feelings of the human heart. You can manage your children in such a manner that from babyhood they will virtually manage you.

I never let them see that they could annoy me. When they disobeyed, I did not shake them roughly or strike them.

During His ministry one mother with her child desired to find Him, in order that He might lay His hands upon the child. This mother felt that she must take her little one to Jesus for His blessing. She thought of it for some time; for Jesus was not near her, and it seemed too great an undertaking to go to Him. But Jesus came nearer and still nearer, until He was near enough for her to reach Him.

This is especially necessary in the case of those who are weak, or who are taxed with continuous labour. In some countries, where poverty abounds, flesh is the cheapest food. Under these circumstances the change will be made with greater difficulty; but it can be effected. We should, however, consider the situation of the people, and the power of life-long habit, and should be careful not to urge even right ideas unduly. None should be urged to make the change abruptly. The place of meat should be supplied with wholesome foods that are inexpensive. In this matter very much depends on the cook.

Abel grasped the great principles of redemption. He saw himself a sinner, and he saw sin, and its penalty death, standing between his soul and communion with God. He brought the slain victim, the sacrificed life, thus acknowledging the claims of the law that had been transgressed.

One class avail themselves of the appointed sacrifice for sin; the other venture to depend upon their own merits; theirs is a sacrifice without the virtue of divine mediation, and thus it is not able to bring man into favour with God. It is only through the merits of Jesus that our transgressions can be pardoned. Those who feel no need of the blood of Christ, who feel that without divine grace they can by their own works secure the approval of God, are making the same mistake as did Cain. If they do not accept the cleansing blood, they are under condemnation.

It is claimed by some that the human race is in need, not of redemption, but of development,—that it can refine, elevate, and regenerate itself. As Cain thought to secure the divine favour by an offering that lacked the blood of a sacrifice, so do these expect to exalt humanity to the divine standard, independent of the atonement. The history of Cain shows what must be the result. It shows what man will become apart from Christ. Humanity has no power to regenerate itself. It does not tend upward, toward the divine, but downward, toward the satanic. Christ is our only hope. “There is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” “Neither is there salvation in any other.” Acts 4:12."},{"refcode_short":"BEcho April 8,  1912, par. 5","refcode_long":"Australasian Signs of the Times April 8,  1912, paragraph 5","content":"True faith, which relies wholly upon Christ, will be manifested by obedience to all the requirements of God. From Adam's day to the present time the great controversy has been concerning obedience to God's law.

But the Scriptures declare that by works is “faith made perfect;” and that, without the works of obedience, faith “is dead.” James 2:22, 17.

Notwithstanding Cain's disregard of the divine command, God did not leave him to himself; but He condescended to reason with the man who had shown himself so unreasonable. And the Lord said unto Cain, “Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. Genesis 4:6, 7.
