White is indissolubly linked with the rise and growth of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Through her writing and public speaking, this spirit-filled messenger of God rallied the dispirited believers after the Great Disappointment of 1844, gave them new hope, focused their attention on “present truth” In the bible, and called them to carry the three angels’ messages to the entire world. Her prophetic gift, coupled with her unwavering confidence in the Bible as the infallible test of both truth and experience, provided the bedrock foundation for a movement so small when it began that only God's special providence could have made it what it is today—a world-wide church of millions, with workers in all corners of the globe proclaiming the good news that Jesus is coming soon."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 1.2","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 1.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Writing was an essential element of Ellen White's ministry. Beginning as a teen-ager, this remarkable woman wrote out the messages that God laid on her heart and showed to her in vision. As the years progressed, her writings provided counsel on almost every phase of personal life and church development. God revealed to her the needs both of people individually and of the church corporately, and she did not hesitate to communicate heaven's advice and solutions. Only a person who believed totally in her divine call would have used her time and strength so unstintingly in the painstaking task of writing out by hand the inspired messages. Often these messages arrived at exactly the right time to keep the church from being drawn off course."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 1.3","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 1.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"But writing was only one phase of Ellen White's prophetic ministry. Without any formal training in public speaking, Mrs. White became one of the most effective and dynamic speakers of her time. When word was circulated that she would be the speaker at either church or secular events, crowds would gather from far and near. Using her voice perfectly, she would make herself heard even by listeners standing farthest from the platform. To general audiences she often spoke on the subject of temperance, but always her messages carried overtones of “Christ our righteousness.” She loved to talk about Jesus and His matchless charms."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 1.4","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 1.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Four years ago we published Volume 1 of Sermons and Talks. the response was so enthusiastic that we herewith offer volume 2. Like the messages in Volume 1, the sermons and talks in this volume are mostly from the latter half of Ellen White's ministry. This may be attributed to the fact that her messages were more faithfully reported in that period than during the early years. These messages were stenographically reported, hence by reading this book a person receives the true “feel” of Mrs. White as a speaker."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 1.5","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 1.5 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"We trust that a deepening of spiritual insight and a closer fellowship with the Lord will reward all who read the messages in this book.

That light has been given line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little.

Is it because heaven is sealed? Is it because there are no precious lessons in store for us? Is it because our source of strength and power is exhausted, and we can receive no more? Why is it that we are not all light in the Lord? He who was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, who was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities, by whose stripes we are healed. [He] is high and lifted up, and the glory of His train fills the temple. Why is this glory withheld from us who are in a world of sin and trouble, sorrow and sadness, corruption and iniquity?"},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 1.9","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 1.9 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The trouble lies with ourselves. It is our iniquities which have separated us from God. It is because we do not feel our need, because we do not hunger and thirst after righteousness, that we are not filled. The promise is that if we hunger and thirst after righteousness we shall be filled. The promise is to you, my brethren and sisters. It is to me, it is to every one of us. It is the hungering, thirsting souls who will be filled. We may come to Christ just as we are, with our weakness, our folly and imperfections, and in repentance drop at His feet, offering our petition in faith."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 1.10","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 1.10 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In spite of our errors, our continual backsliding, the voice of the long-suffering Saviour is heard inviting us, “Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” To the needy, the fainting, those who are weighed down with burden and care and perplexity, the invitation is, “Come.” It is Christ's glory to encircle us in the arms of His mercy and love, and bind up our wounds, to sympathize with those who need sympathy, and strengthen those who need strength. When we have been almost ready to sink, we have sent up the earnest cry, “Lord, save, or I perish,” and how sweet it has been to find His hand stretched out to save. He has been to us just what He promised, a present help in every time of need."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 2.1","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 2.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The Lord has graciously invited all to come. When He was on earth He said to the unbelieving, obstinate Pharisees, “Ye will not come unto Me, that ye might have life.” Oh, that this may never be said of us. There is life and peace and joy in Jesus Christ. He is the sinner's friend. There is power and glory and strength for us all in Him, and if we believe that this power and glory is ours, if we comply with the conditions laid down in His Word, we shall be strong in the strength of the mighty One."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 2.2","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 2.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"There are many who may well be represented by the vine that is trailing upon the ground, and entwining its tendrils about the roots and rubbish that lie in its path. To all such the message comes, “Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty” [2 Corinthians 6:17, 18]."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 2.3","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 2.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"There are conditions to meet if we would be blessed and honored and exalted by God. It is separation from the world, a refusal to touch those things which would separate our affections from God. God has the first and highest claim upon you. Set your affections upon Him and heavenly things. Your tendrils must be severed from everything earthly. You are exhorted to touch not the unclean thing, for in doing this you will yourself become unclean. It is impossible for you to unite with those who are corrupt and still remain pure. “What fellowship hath light with darkness? and what concord hath Christ with Belial?” God and Christ and the heavenly host would have man know that if he unites with the corrupt, he will become corrupt. If we are found mingling with the world, we shall share the fate of the world."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 2.4","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 2.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The requirements of God are set plainly before us, and the question to be settled is, Will we comply with them? Will we accept the conditions laid down in His Word—separation from the world? This is not the work of a moment or of a day. It is not accomplished by bowing at the family altar and offering up lip service, neither by public exhortation and prayer. It is a life-long work. Our consecration to God must be a living principle, interwoven with the life, and leading to self-denial and self-sacrifice. It must underlie all our thoughts and be the spring of every action. This will elevate us above the world, and separate us from its polluting influence."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 3.1","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 3.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"All our actions are affected by our religious experience, and if this experience is founded on God, and we understand the mysteries of godliness, if we are daily receiving of the power of the world to come, and hold communion with God, and have the fellowship of the Spirit, if we are each day holding with a firmer grasp the higher life, and drawing closer and still closer to the bleeding side of the Redeemer, we shall have inwrought in us principles that are holy and elevating. Then it will be as natural for us to seek purity and holiness and separation from the world as it is for the angels of glory to execute the mission of love assigned them in saving mortals from the corrupting influence of the world."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 3.2","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 3.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Everyone who enters the pearly gates of the city of God will be a doer of the Word. He will be a partaker of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. It is our privilege to realize the fullness there is in Christ, and be blessed by the provision made through Him.

Will it hinder us from doing good to those around us? No; the firmer hold we have on heaven, the greater will be our power of usefulness in the world. We should study to copy the Pattern, that the Spirit that dwelt in Christ may dwell in us. The Saviour was not found among the exalted and honorable of the world. He did not spend His time among those who were seeking their ease and pleasure. He went about doing good. His work was to help those who needed help, to save the lost and perishing, to lift up the bowed down, to break the yoke of oppression from those who were in bondage, to heal the afflicted, and to speak words of sympathy and consolation to the distressed and sorrowing."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 3.4","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 3.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"We are required to copy this Pattern. Let us be up and doing, seeking to bless the needy and comfort the distressed. The more we partake of the Spirit of Christ, the more we shall see to do for our fellow man. We shall be filled with a love for perishing souls, and shall find our delight in following the footsteps of the Majesty of heaven."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 3.5","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 3.5 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Probation is about to close. In heaven the edict will soon go forth, “It is done.” “He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still. And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be” [Revelation 22:11, 12]. Then the last prayer for sinners will have been offered, the last tear shed, the last warning given, the last entreaty made. The sweet voice of mercy will be heard no more."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 4.1","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 4.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"This is why Satan is making such mighty efforts to secure men and women in his snare. He has come down with great power, knowing that his [time] is short. His special work now is to secure professing Christians in his ranks, that he may through them allure and destroy souls. The enemy is playing the game of life for every soul. He is working to remove everything of a spiritual nature from us, and in the place of the precious graces of Christ [to] crowd our hearts with all the evil traits of the carnal nature—hatred, evil surmising, jealousy, love of the world, love of self, love of pleasure, and pride of life. We need to be fortified against the incoming of the foe, who is working with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish, for if we are not watchful and prayerful, these evils will enter the heart and crowd out all that is good."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 4.2","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 4.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Many who profess to believe the Word of God do not seem to understand the deceptive working of the enemy. They do not realize that the end of time is near. But Satan knows it, and while men sleep he works. The lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eye, and the pride of life are controlling men and women. Satan is at work, even among the people of God, to cause disunion and difference of opinion. There is biting and devouring among them, and Satan designs that they shall be consumed one of another. Selfishness, corruption, and evil of every kind is taking a firm hold upon hearts."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 4.3","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 4.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"With many the precious Word of God is neglected. A novel or a story book engages the attention and fascinates the mind. Anything that will excite the imagination is eagerly devoured, while the Word of God is set aside. Why was it that the Jewish nation rejected and turned from Christ, insisting [that] a robber be granted them and that the Prince of life be crucified? Why did such blindness come upon the people? It was because they overlooked the Word of Life, because they failed to search the Scriptures."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 4.4","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 4.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In these last days many are weighed in the balances and found wanting, because they suffer their minds to be engrossed with things of little importance, while eternal truth is neglected. The truth of God, which would elevate, sanctify, refine, and fit us for the finishing touch of immortality, is set aside for things of minor importance. Oh, that this blindness might pass away, and men and women understand the work that Satan is accomplishing among them."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 5.1","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 5.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Provision has been made whereby the communication between heaven and our souls may be free and open, that we may have the influence of the holy angels. We can place ourselves where rays of light and glory from the throne of God will be given us in abundance.

Like Sodom and Gomorrah all would perish beneath the wrath of an offended God. But the world is not left in darkness. The long-suffering and mercy of God is still extended to the children of men. It is His design that the divine rays of light which emanate from the throne of God shall be received in our hearts and reflected by the children of light."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 5.3","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 5.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The love revealed in the Saviour's life of self-denial and self-sacrifice is to be seen in the lives of His followers. We are called upon “so to walk even as He walked.” The cause of our weakness lies in our refusal to obey this command. On every side there are opportunities to work for our fellow men, not only in supplying their temporal wants, but their spiritual necessities. It is our duty to lead souls to the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. It is important that we fill aright our position in the world, in society, and in the church; but we cannot do this unless we have a firm hold upon righteousness."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 5.4","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 5.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Our faith must reach within the veil, whither our Forerunner has for us entered.

It was thus that Enoch walked with God. It was no easier for Enoch to live a righteous life in his day than it is for us at the present time. The world in Enoch's time was no more favorable to a growth in grace and holiness than it is now, but Enoch devoted time to prayer and communion with God, and this enabled him to escape the corruption that is in the world through lust. It is his devotion to God that fitted him for translation."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 5.6","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 5.6 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"We are living amid the perils of the last days, and we must receive our strength from the same source as did Enoch.

They have not tasted its first draught. They talk of the cross of Christ, they profess the faith, but they have had no experience in self-denial, lifting the cross and bearing it after their Lord. If they were partakers of the divine nature, the same spirit that dwelt in their Lord would dwell in them. The same tenderness and love, the same pity and compassion, would be manifested in their lives. They would not then wait to have the needy and unfortunate come to them, and be entreated to feel for their woes. It would be as natural for them to aid the needy and minister to their wants as it was for Christ to go about doing good."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 6.3","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 6.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Every man, woman, and youth who professes the religion of Christ should realize the responsibility resting upon them. All should feel that this is an individual work, an individual warfare, an individual preaching of Christ in the daily practice. If each would realize this, and take hold of the work, we should be mighty as an army with banners. The heavenly dove would hover over us. The Sun of Righteousness would shine upon us, and the light of the glory of God would no more be shut away from us than it was from the devoted Enoch."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 6.4","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 6.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The command is given us, “Come out from among them, and be ye separate.” It is not for you to say, I have nothing to do with my neighbor; he is buried in the world; I am not his keeper. For this very reason you should have something to say to him. The light given you, you should not hide under a bushel. You are not to keep it for yourself alone. This is entirely contrary to the will of God. Let your light shine before men, is the command. Will you let it shine—by your words, your deeds?"},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 6.5","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 6.5 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"It may be understood that you believe the Sabbath, that you believe in the Lord's soon return; but what good will that do your neighbor unless you carry this belief into your daily life?

Your profession may be as high as heaven, but it will not save you or your fellow men unless you are a Christian. Your example will go farther toward enlightening the world than all your profession. We want the living preacher carried out in the living example. In this way your light will shine, and others, seeing your good works, will glorify your Father which is in heaven."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 7.1","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 7.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Oh, that the Lord would give us to feel as we have never felt before.

This is a blessed promise. Many times, when I have been discouraged and almost in despair, I have come to the Lord with this promise, and said, “Let me take hold of Thy strength, that I may make peace with Thee; and I shall make peace with Thee.” And as I have laid hold of the strength of God, I have found a peace which passeth understanding."},{"refcode_short":"2SAT 7.5","refcode_long":"Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, p. 7.5 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I know that the words I speak to you are truth, and that you need them.

Satan is already weaving his net about you, and ensnaring your soul. He does not wait for his prey to be brought to him. He goes about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. But does he always roar? No; when it serves his purpose best, he sinks his voice to the softest whisper, and, wrapped in garments of light, appears as an angel from heaven.

Do not give the impression that you are like a fox, stealing in to get sheep, but lay right open before the minister the fact that you want to call his attention to precious truths in the word of God. Ministers have been treated by some of our laborers very much as though they were heathen, and they feel it.

At any rate it is fair and right to give them an opportunity to be favorable and kind if they will. If by earnest, prayerful, Christlike efforts you can bring one minister into the truth, [you through his influence may be able] to convert a score of souls. We have not one point of truth that we need be ashamed of, and therefore we should be perfectly fair and open in laying these things before those who are intelligent and who are in responsible positions. Treat them as honest men. You can speak with them in regard to matters of general religious interest, perhaps seeking information on some points, without coming directly and pointedly to the subject of the truth itself.

If he does this labor in the meekness of Christ, he will surely have the angels of God to work with his efforts. But we are altogether too faithless and too narrow in our ideas and in our plans.

Nevertheless, there are men of wealth who will embrace the truth here in Europe if the right kind of labor is put forth. The Lord has agents here whom He has trusted with means to carry forward His work in these countries. When those who are poor embrace the truth and do to the very best of their ability, our heavenly Father will see when they have gone to the extent of their ability, and He will bring in other talents in order to carry forward His work.

The ripe fruit was so mingled with the green that we could pick only one or two berries from a cluster. I commenced to gather the fruit very carefully for fear of picking the green berries, but my pail, which held two quarts, was quickly filled. Some of the nice large fruit had fallen from the bushes to the ground, and was half consumed by birds and insects. “Oh,” thought I, “if this field had only been entered before, all this precious fruit might have been gathered and saved. But it is too late now. I will, however, pick these from the ground, and see if there is any good in them.

I said, “There is plenty more to be gathered from these bushes.” They commenced picking, but soon stopped, saying, “It is not fair for us to pick here; you found this spot, and the fruit is yours.” Said I, “That makes no difference.

After the sufferings of Christ, after His crucifixion and resurrection and proclamation over the rent sepulcher of Joseph, “I am the resurrection and the life,” after His words to the five hundred who assembled to see Him in Galilee, and after His ascension to heaven, the disciples had some idea of what the love of God comprehended, and of the love they were to exercise one toward another.

In loving one another as Christ has loved humanity, we receive sanctification of the soul and obtain that faith which works by love and purifies the soul.

The influence of the Word of God is to have a sanctifying effect on our speech, our actions, our association with every member of the family, and with strangers. The leaven of truth must bring under control the temper and the voice.

The same sensitive pride, the same yielding to natural inclination, the same perversities of character are seen as if the truth were totally unknown by them. They have closed the windows and drawn the blinds of the soul, and shut out the sunshine of the righteousness of Christ, and then complain that they have no sweet joy, no assurance and happiness in believing the truth.

Instead of spending our time in playing the games that so many students play, let us strive to do something for the Master. We have decided that the best course you can pursue is to do missionary work in the neighborhood.

One writer brings in points that another does not bring in. If these points are essential, why did not all these writers mention them? It is because the minds of men differ, and do not comprehend all things in exactly the same way. Some Scripture truths appeal much more strongly to the minds of certain persons than to others; some points appear to be much more important to some than to others. The same principle applies to speakers. Some speakers dwell at considerable length on points that others would pass by quickly, or not mention at all.
