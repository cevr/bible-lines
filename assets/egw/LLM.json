Second, That in order for our students to enter other medical colleges after the charter is secured, we would need to strengthen our course of study in the first two years about three hundred hours, or one hundred and fifty each year. The students would have to meet the State requirements for entering the College, which is at present a high school education or its equivalent. Third, almost any regular medical college in America would receive our students for advanced work if these requirements were met. Fourth, in reference to the outlay financially, to do this work acceptably to the State, about $3000. Then, to meet what we feel is necessary to give practical work, we should have a small sanitarium, costing not more than $6000 or $7000.

Inasmuch as we give in our medical course not only the scientific training, but the Bible and our methods of treatment as well, we could not cover the first two years of a regular medical college course in the same time; but our three years course we find will be readily accepted for two years of a regular medical course."},{"refcode_short":"LLM 13.2","refcode_long":"Loma Linda Messages, p. 13.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"“Now as to the question involved. Would there be danger, first, in securing a charter for the school that would open the way for the Loma Linda students to secure this advantage in worldly schools of completing their course, and becoming accredited physicians? Would such a plan lead away from the purpose of the school—to qualify large numbers with the ability of physicians to labor as evangelists? The brethren generally seem to feel that it would be out of the question for us to think of equipping the Loma Linda College with facilities for giving a full medical course to qualify students to receive recognition by the State. Hence the suggestion of this compromise plan, which would keep the students under right influences for three years, while becoming well grounded in Bible study along with their scientific preparation. Then it is thought that if only the most capable were encouraged to go on and complete the full course as accredited physicians, and all others were encouraged to enter the work as evangelists, all might work out satisfactorily."},{"refcode_short":"LLM 13.3","refcode_long":"Loma Linda Messages, p. 13.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"“Without going further into detail, we desire to lay the matter before you for your consideration, to see if the Lord has any light for us."},{"refcode_short":"LLM 14","refcode_long":"Loma Linda Messages, p. 14 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"To be Separate from the World"},{"refcode_short":"LLM 14.1","refcode_long":"Loma Linda Messages, p. 14.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Sister White read this letter carefully early in the morning, and later in the day, in an interview with Elder Burden and Elder W.

In His way of working, He has left us a perfect example. “If any man will come after me,” He declared, “let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.” The true medical missionary will obey these words. He will not strain every nerve to make a display, thinking thus to win souls to the Saviour. The Son of God left His heavenly home to come to a world all seared and marred by the curse, that He might seek and save the Lost. Ought we not, His followers, to show the same self-denial and self-sacrifice that His life revealed? For us He endured the privations of poverty.

He has thought that it was his right to rule in every branch of the conference work, and this has led him to judge and criticize fellow-laborers who were better able than he to do the work.

If you will take your position firmly to counterwork the influence you have exerted against the Testimonies of the Spirit of God, then the Lord can accept you. But while you remain in an unsettled condition, having more confidence in your own judgment than you have in the counsel of the Lord, you are doing a work to undermine the confidence of the people in the work of the Lord. I must say to you, Elder Reaser, that there is need for much searching of self, for you have much prejudice to overcome. One seed of unbelief sown in the heart, will change the atmosphere of the soul. There is a far-reaching work to be done in counterworking the work of unbelief that has been done. If you will place yourself under the control of the Spirit of God, the Lord will help you to do this.

The president of the Southern Calif. Conference, after consulting with some of his associates, even instructed the others not to act, save on their own individual responsibility.

As Elder Irwin recounted the special providences connected with the establishment of the Cooranbong school, and how every specification that had been outlined regarding the future work and prosperity of that school, had been met, the hearts of the brethren in responsibility in Southern California gathered courage, and the Loma Linda enterprise was recognized as a Conference enterprise."},{"refcode_short":"LLM 400.1","refcode_long":"Loma Linda Messages, p. 400.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Afterward, it is true, when the servant of the Lord began to bear them message after message pointing out the necessity of inaugurating and developing an untried and difficult line of educational work at Loma Linda, the faith of many wavered, and for a time some in authority did much to hinder the carrying forward of this new line of training.

They have chosen to accept what the world calls knowledge in the place of the truths which God has committed to men through His ministers and prophets and apostles. And there are some who, having secured this world education, think that they can introduce it into our schools.

The Word is to be the chief study in our schools. Here we may hold converse with patriarchs and prophets; here we may learn what our redemption has cost.

Shall we by our course seem to acknowledge that there is a stronger power with unbelievers than there is with God's own people? When we take hold upon God, and trust in him, He will work in our behalf. But whatever the consequences may be, we are, in regard to our faith, to stand distinct and separate from the world. I feel a decided interest in the work at Loma Linda, and I desire that it shall exert a powerful influence for the truth. Your success depends upon the blessing of God, not upon the ideas and views of men who are opposed to the requirements of the law of God. When people see that God blesses us, and gives success to our work, as we make Him supreme, then they will be led to give consideration to the truth we teach. Many will be compelled to recognize that our methods are superior to those employed in the schools of the world, as they are commonly conducted. We need not tie to men in order to secure influence, we need not think that we are dependent upon the knowledge and experience of men who do not recognize the Lord as their Master. Our God is a God of knowledge and understanding, and if we will take our position decidedly on His side, to be wholly influenced by His spirit, He will give us wisdom. I would that all our people might see the inconsistency of those who profess to be God's Commandment-keeping people, a peculiar people, zealous of good works, thinking that they must copy after the world's pattern in order to make their work successful. Our God is stronger than any human influence. If we will accept Him as our educator, if we will make Him our strength and righteousness, He will work in our behalf. The following out of these principles, may result in a condition of things that is not just as we desire it to be. We might like to see certain conditions for the attainment of which we would be dependent on the world, but the result would be an experience that means weakness rather than strength. We should realize a bondage that we do not anticipate. Jesus Christ is our Saviour today, and He is willing to work in our behalf, if we will not put our dependence upon some other power. If we are sustained by the living God a superiority of His power will be manifest in His people. This is the testimony that I will continue to bear.

I was shown how that in a special sense we as a people are to be guided by divine instruction. Those fitting themselves for medical missionary work should fear to place themselves under worldly doctors, to imbibe their sentiments and peculiar prejudices, and to learn to express their ideas and views.... It is not necessary that our medical missionaries follow the precise track marked out by medical men of the world. They do not need to administer drugs to the sick. They do not need to follow the drug medication in order to have influence in their work. The message was given me that if they would consecrate themselves to the Lord, if they would seek to obtain under men ordained of God, a thorough knowledge of their work, the Lord would make them skillful.... Some of our medical missionaries have supposed that a medical training according to the plans of worldly schools is essential to their success. To those who have thought that the only way to success is by being taught by worldly men and by pursuing a course that is sanctioned by worldly men, I would now say, put away such ideas. This is a mistake that should be corrected. It is a dangerous thing to catch the spirit of the world; the popularity which such a course invites, will bring into the work a spirit which the word of God cannot sanction. It is a lack of faith in the power of God that leads our physicians to lean so much upon the arm of law, and to trust so much to the influence of worldly powers. The true medical missionary will be wise in the treatment of the sick, using the remedies that nature provides. And then he will look to Christ as the true healer of diseases. The principles of health reform brought into the life of the patient, the use of nature's remedies and the cooperation of divine agencies in behalf of the suffering, will bring success."},{"refcode_short":"LLM 555.1","refcode_long":"Loma Linda Messages, p. 555.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I am instructed to say that in our educational work there is to be no compromise in order to meet the world's standards.
