This view of the matter may startle some into a consideration of what kind of guidance the flock of God is receiving today. There needs to be much more well-organized effort and far less preaching. The instruction given in the church is to be given modestly. If the teacher be a doer of the Word he seeks to hold forth to others, he will in all meekness and humbleness of mind open the door of his mind and heart to the instruction of this Word, for “The entrance of Thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple” [Psalm 119:130]."},{"refcode_short":"21MR 2.1","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 21 [Nos. 1501-1598], p. 2.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"“Hear this word that the Lord hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying, You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.

The people have long been under deception through false theories, but error, although it may be hoary with age, cannot be converted into truth. The idols of error must be expelled from mind and heart that the healing waters of life may flow into the soul. The fetters of education must be broken. Prejudice and superstition must be given up.

I hope that as Christians you will be awake to your ever-increasing responsibilities, and be prepared to act the part of faithful stewards, both of means and of talents. Will you lay aside all selfish interests, and all sectional feelings, and manifest your missionary zeal to work for the best interest of the cause of God?

Satan with his hosts is arrayed against any and every enterprise that will be for the saving of souls.

We need the faith that is a working power to convert the soul, and then we shall strengthen our brethren. There are so few who feel the necessity of disciplining the soul, seeking grace daily that they may appreciate the position we occupy, and arouse in others the earnest devotion so much needed at this time.

When these students shall be in a position where they can replace what they receive, they should do so, that the fund may be kept good. Our colleges are not able to give the students their tuition, for they do not, like other denominational schools, receive donations and endowments. Hence there is greater necessity for raising special funds to be wisely appropriated by the judgment of a board of directors. There are many unordained men and also women who can do much in the several branches of the work in the great harvest field.
