After Christ's ascension, the Holy Spirit was given to man to assist all who would co-operate with Him in the reshaping and remodelling of the human character. The Holy Spirit's part of the work has been defined by our Saviour. He says, “He will convince the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment.” The Holy Spirit is the convictor,*The original publication had the spelling “convicter.” and sanctifier as well. As none can repent of their sins until they are convicted, the necessity of uniting the Spirit with us in our labour to reach the fallen is apparent. All of our human abilities will be exercised in vain unless we are united to the heavenly intelligences. It is through the lack of a knowledge of the vitalizing truth, and the corrupting influence of error, that men are fallen so low, sunk in the depths of sinful degradation. Angels and men are to work in harmony to teach the truth of God to those who are unlearned therein, that they may be set free from the bonds of sin. It is the truth alone that makes men free.

Entire consecration in the service of God will reveal the moulding influence of the Holy Spirit at every step along the way. When apparent impossibilities arise in your path, present the ever-ready, complete efficiency of the Holy Spirit before your unbelieving heart, that it may shame away your over-cautious spirit. When your faith is weak, your efforts feeble, talk of the great Comforter, the Strength of heaven. When you are inclined to doubt that God is working, by His Holy Spirit, through human agents, remember that God has used the church, and is using it to the glory of His own name.

He assures us that He is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to those that ask Him, than parents are to give good gifts unto their children. Since it is possible for every one to have the heavenly unction, “ye need not that any man teach you,” and there is no excuse for shunning responsibilities; no duty should be unwelcome, no obligation evaded.

The messengers of heaven are to be seen running to and fro, seeking in every way possible to warn the people of the coming judgments, and presenting the glad tidings of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. The standard of righteousness is to be exalted. The Spirit of God is moving upon men's hearts, and those who respond to its influence will become lights in the world.

None will come in vain to Christ to inquire for a clearer knowledge of truth, for He has declared, “If any will do the will of God he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God or whether I speak of Myself.” Those who have yielded their will to God are receiving a training in Christ's school to do all the justice possible to His divinity.

With this burden of sin upon him, the paralytic was let down before Christ. The Saviour knew just where to commence His work for the sufferer.

And, above all these things, put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.” Now, I thought if all this company here would just carry out these words that are here, why, we should be ready for translation; we certainly would be ready for the work of God to go forward in the world. And now here is something that I want you to consider: “And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which ye also are called in one body; and be ye thankful.” What an influence you could carry if everyone would carry out these principles. But there is something more. “Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks unto God and the Father by Him.” Well, now, is not that very precious; I think it is very precious. Then we read in Ephesians, “And be not drunk with wine wherein is excess.” Here is something you can be filled with; it will restore the moral image of God in man: “But be filled with the Spirit.” Then we can be, that is a possibility. Then let us let it; let us let the Spirit of God dwell in our hearts, and give no place for the devil. Here it says again: “Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your hearts.” Do not you think that we should do this, and if we should sing more to the glory of God, and if we should be cheerful and not appear as if we were a band of mourners going to the cemetery; do you not think that if we lifted up our heads and rejoiced because our redemption draweth nigh there would be altogether a different atmosphere surrounding our souls? Now, I felt very thankful indeed that Brother Haskell came just at the time of the first term of our school, and we had a blessed school. Every soul that came to the school for that term was converted. The Bible was opened, and there seemed to be a treasure house that Brother Haskell could draw from and present it to the people, and it was of the greatest value to us. I thank the Lord to see this congregation here, a large company. I feel sorry we cannot have the labours of Brother Haskell here and have them in America, but we cannot have both, and the Lord will give us the strength if it is his duty to go there. I am very thankful to meet Brother Irwin. It has seemed like having a little piece of America here, and here we can speak and pray together, although I was ill for a week and could not get out. I thought I would have to take time to recover, but the Spirit of the Lord strengthened me and blessed me.

Time has passed into eternity that should have been improved by our people. If hindrances had not been placed in the way, the Sanitarium would have been erected long ago, and would now be doing its work. Now, though only a portion of the means has come in, we venture to go forward with this work. The plan of the building drawn up by Brother M. G.

The owners of the present Sanitarium building have kindly extended our time of occupation to accommodate our real necessities; but the building must soon be vacated, and we must have a place in which to carry on the work now in progress.

These can make their donations in time, by working extra hours. And let them work these hours faithfully as in the sight of all the heavenly universe. Others can help the cause by reducing their price of labour; and thus each day small sums will be sent in by the different workmen. Brethren, let us practise self-denial at this special time, which calls for all, old and young, to help. There must be no failure to meet the demand, that the building may advance.

A school for the children is conducted in the basement of the meeting-house. In another part of the city a workingmen's home and medical mission is maintained. On Market Street, near the City Hall, there is a bath establishment, operated as a branch of the St. Helena Sanitarium.

These publications will do a far greater work than can be accomplished by the ministry of the word alone. Through the work of the canvasser, the silent messengers of truth that are placed in the homes of the people, enlightening and confirming men and women, will strengthen the gospel ministry in every way; for the Holy Spirit will impress minds as they read the books, just as he impresses the minds of those who listen to the preaching of the word by God's delegated ministers, and the same ministry of angels attends the books which contain the truth as attends the work of the minister who is educating the people as to the truth.

America has many institutions to give character to the work. Similar facilities should be furnished for England, Australia, Germany, and Scandinavia, and other continental countries as the work advances. In these countries the Lord has able workmen, laborers of experience. These can lead out in the establishment of institutions, the training of workers, and the carrying forward of the work in its different lines. God designs that they shall be furnished with means and facilities. The institutions established would give character to the work in these countries, and would give opportunity for the training of workers for the darker heathen nations.

Of all the gifts which God has given to man, none is more precious than the gift of speech, if it is sanctified by the Holy Spirit. It is with the tongue that we convince and persuade: with it we offer prayer and praise to God, and with it we convey rich thoughts of the Redeemer's love. Those who are fitted to enlighten minds will often have opportunity to read from the Bible or from books which teach the truth, and thus bring the evidence to enlighten souls. When canvassers discover those who are interestedly searching for truth, they should hold Bible readings with them. These Bible readings are just what the people need.

You can be firm without violent threatenings or scoldings. I have seen a mother snatch from the hand of her child something that was giving it special pleasure. The child did not know the reason for this, and naturally felt abused. Then followed a quarrel between parent and child, and a sharp chastisement ended the scene as far as outward appearances were concerned. But that battle left on the tender mind an impression that could not be easily effaced. I said to the mother: “You have wronged your child deeply; you have hurt his soul, and lost his confidence. How this will be restored I know not.” This mother acted unwisely. She did not reason from cause to effect. Her harsh, injudicious management stirred up the worst passions in the heart of her child, and on every similar occasion these passions are aroused and strengthened.
