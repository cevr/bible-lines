The church was growing, more than doubling its membership in the ten-year period. With rapidity its workers were entering new countries. Institutions at home and abroad were brought into being. The original provisions for organization devised at the first General Conference session in 1863 were being rapidly outgrown. Older established institutions were expanding and entering upon a period of popularity with both Seventh-day Adventists and the world. This growth was fraught with many perils, from liberalism on one hand to consolidation and centralization on the other hand. Then, in and through the experience of this period, there were elements reflecting the aftermath of the 1888 General Conference session held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where certain doctrinal issues were discussed heatedly and at length. A number of men identified themselves with one camp or the other, with their decisions influenced not alone by the doctrinal arguments presented, but also molded by attitudes toward the spirit of prophecy counsels. In some cases these attitudes were not wholesome. Through most of this period, Ellen White was in Australia, laboring to build up the work in that newly entered land and leading out in the establishment of a college and a sanitarium in that continent."},{"refcode_short":"TM xvi.1","refcode_long":"Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, p. xvi.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"This volume bears the title of Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers. It is not devoted essentially to instruction as to how the work of the minister should be conducted, as is Gospel Workers. This volume contains messages given to admonish, warn, reprove, and counsel the ministers of the church, with special attention given to perils peculiar to men who stand in positions of responsibility. Some of the reproofs are severe, but the assurance is given that God in his chastening, “wounds only that he may heal, not cause to perish.”—Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 23."},{"refcode_short":"TM xvi.2","refcode_long":"Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, p. xvi.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The reproofs and counsels directed to ministers and especially administrators were not published initially by Ellen G.

For the most part they were messages directed originally to the President of the General Conference, O. A. Olsen, and his associates in administrative work, particularly in Battle Creek.

Let us turn back the pages of history and look at some important developments."},{"refcode_short":"TM xvii.2","refcode_long":"Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, p. xvii.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"From the very outset, Sabbath-keeping Adventists were characterized by their eagerness to understand God's will and to walk in his way. In their Advent experience of the mid-1840's they had witnessed the stable Protestant churches, with their creedal stakes firmly driven, turn from great truths taught in the word of God. Many of these Adventists had been cast out of these churches because of their Advent hope, a hope which sprang from the Scriptures. They had seen their former brethren enter into active opposition to those who held and expounded Bible truths. This led them to be fearful of formality and church organization. But as the way began to open for the heralding of the third angel's message, the need for organization developed, and in January, 1850, Ellen White was shown that the Sabbath-keeping Adventists should bring their work into order, for “everything in heaven was in perfect order.”—Manuscript 11, 1850."},{"refcode_short":"TM xvii.3","refcode_long":"Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, p. xvii.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Earnest efforts to bring about church organization spanned the decade of the 1850's. They culminated in 1860 in the choice of the name “Seventh-day Adventists,” And, in 1861, in plans for the organization of local churches and state conferences. Then in 1863, the state conferences were bound together in the General Conference. Painstaking care was exercised to avoid the first step in forming a creed, for it was apparent that the church could not have creedal stakes firmly Driven, and at the same time be free to follow God's opening providences as revealed through a study of the word of God and the revelations of the Spirit of prophecy. An excellent statement reviewing God's providence in instituting church order appears on pages 24-32."},{"refcode_short":"TM xviii.1","refcode_long":"Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, p. xviii.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"At the time of the organization of the General Conference in 1863, a General Conference Committee of three men was chosen. The major interests of the church consisted of the several state conferences and a publishing house located at Battle Creek, Michigan. In the evangelistic field, increasing success came to Seventh-day Adventist ministers. Their work consisted mainly in preaching the distinctive truths of the gospel message, including the Sabbath, the state of the dead, the second advent, and the sanctuary. Many of the men were drawn into discussions and debates involving the law of God and other vital Bible truths. Imperceptibly, not a few of those who engaged in such discussions became self-reliant, and there developed in their hearts a spirit of sureness, self-dependence, and argumentativeness. In time this bore unwholesome fruit."},{"refcode_short":"TM xviii","refcode_long":"Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, p. xviii (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Institutional Development"},{"refcode_short":"TM xviii.2","refcode_long":"Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, p. xviii.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Institutional development followed quickly on the heels of the organization of the General Conference. In the vision given to Ellen White in December, 1865, a medical institution was called for, and in response the leaders opened a small health institute in Battle Creek in September, 1866. Less than a decade later, in the messages which came from the pen of Ellen White, a school was called for. In 1874, Battle Creek College was built. Thus three major institutional developments forged ahead in Battle Creek, drawing an ever-enlarging number of Seventh-day Adventists into a rapidly growing denominational center. Men of business experience were called in to care for the business interests of the institutions. As the business interests expanded and developed and prospered, some of these men came to trust more in their business acumen than in God's messages of guidance. To them, business was business."},{"refcode_short":"TM xix.1","refcode_long":"Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, p. xix.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Before a decade had passed the denomination was confronted with a struggle between the interests of an educational program founded on Spirit of prophecy principles and the educational program of the world, guided by men steeped in worldly policies and methods."},{"refcode_short":"TM xix.2","refcode_long":"Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, p. xix.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The pioneers of the Seventh-day Adventist Church were largely self-made men. They were men of consecration, ability, and skill. One has but to read their writings to discern this. But, knowing the limitations of their scholastic backgrounds, they were inclined to feel very humble. When there came into their midst in the early 1880's an educator bearing his degrees, it is not surprising that he should be pushed ahead into the position of leadership in the educational work. Elevated quickly to a position of high trust at a time when he knew but little of the doctrines and history of Seventh-day Adventists, he was found to be unprepared for the responsibilities placed upon him."},{"refcode_short":"TM xix.3","refcode_long":"Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, p. xix.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The issues became painfully acute, with leaders and laymen in Battle Creek taking sides. Some were swept off their feet by the leadership of an educator with his degrees, while others endeavored to stand with those things set forth in the Spirit of prophecy counsels. The outcome was disastrous to the college and to the experience of those involved. Battle Creek College was closed for a year.

In 1882 two new schools were started, one at Healdsburg, California, and the other at South Lancaster, Massachusetts. In 1885 the publishing work was established in Basel, Switzerland, in the newly built central publishing house. The same year workers were sent to Australia, and soon the Echo Publishing Company was established in Melbourne. The personal presence of Ellen G.

This was seen in the spirit which developed in the hearts of men who engaged in discussions and debates. It was seen in the experience of businessmen connected with the cause. It was seen in the experience of missionaries going out to new countries, who, with narrow concepts of the work, found it difficult to move forward in the way God would have them take. It was seen in the tendency shown by some to depend upon the leaders at Battle Creek for guidance in the minute affairs of a far-flung mission work.

The General Conference Committee consisted of seven men, the Committee having been cautiously enlarged in 1882 from three members to five and in 1886 from five to seven. To take care of the legal business of the cause, the General Conference Association had been formed with a Board of five Trustees. Various branches of the work had developed into somewhat autonomous organizations, such as the “International Sabbath School Association,” The “Health and Temperance Association,” and the “International Tract and Missionary Association.” As has been noted, for two years, mid-1885 to 1887, Ellen White had been in Europe. Now she was back in the United States, residing at her Healdsburg, California, home. There were two publishing houses in operation in the United States: the Review and Herald in Battle Creek, Michigan, and the Pacific Press in Oakland, California. Each of these publishing houses did considerable commercial work to keep its equipment and personnel fully employed, and thus to maintain facilities needed for denominational printing.

This was preceded by a week-long Biblical Institute, at which there were discussions as to whether the Huns or the Alemanni should constitute one of the ten kingdoms of Daniel 2 and 7, and Revelation 13. Uriah Smith, editor of the Review and Herald, took a certain position and A. T. Jones, editor of Signs of the Times, took another. E. J. Waggoner, also from the Pacific Press, conducted studies on the atonement and the law of God, and Elder Jones presented justification by faith. These discussions continued into the session itself, and occasionally there was bitter disputation. Some of the ministers had come to the conference to debate certain questions, rather than to study truth.

He is not hungry to stand the highest, to obtain praise from human beings. This is not his eager interest.

A jovial minister in the pulpit, or one who is stretching beyond his measure to win praise, is a spectacle that crucifies the Son of God afresh and puts Him to open shame. There must be thorough repentance, faith in our Saviour Jesus Christ, vigilant watchfulness, unceasing prayer, and diligent searching of the Scriptures. God holds us responsible for all that we might be if we would improve our talents. We shall be judged according to what we ought to have been, but were not; what we might have done, but did not accomplish because we did not use our powers to glorify God. For all knowledge that we might have gained but did not, there will be an eternal loss, even if we do not lose our souls. All our influence belongs to God. All that we acquire is to be used to His glory. All the property that the Lord has entrusted to us is to be held on the altar of God, to be returned to Him again. We are working out our own destiny.

Elaborate reasoning or argumentative demonstrations of doctrines seldom impress upon the hearer the sense of his need and his peril.

The inspired apostle speaks of our being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the Chief Cornerstone. The church of Christ is represented as being built for “an habitation of God through the Spirit.” If we are “rooted and grounded in love,” we shall “be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge.” Oh, precious possibilities and encouragement!

We have the companionship of the divine presence, and as we realize this presence, our thoughts are brought into captivity to Jesus Christ. Our spiritual exercises are in accordance with the vividness of our sense of this companionship. Enoch walked with God in this way; and Christ is dwelling in our hearts by faith when we will consider what He is to us, and what a work He has wrought out for us in the plan of redemption.

The thoughts are pervaded with a sense of His goodness, His love. We contemplate His character, and thus He is in all our thoughts. His love encloses us. If we gaze even a moment upon the sun in its meridian glory, when we turn away our eyes, the image of the sun will appear in everything upon which we look. Thus it is when we behold Jesus; everything we look upon reflects His image, the Sun of Righteousness. We cannot see anything else, or talk of anything else. His image is imprinted upon the eye of the soul and affects every portion of our daily life, softening and subduing our whole nature. By beholding, we are conformed to the divine similitude, even the likeness of Christ. To all with whom we associate we reflect the bright and cheerful beams of His righteousness. We have become transformed in character; for heart, soul, mind, are irradiated by the reflection of Him who loved us and gave Himself for us.

Jesus Christ is everything to us—the first, the last, the best in everything.

When tempted, just say, He cares for me, He makes intercession for me, He loves me, He has died for me. I will give myself unreservedly to Him.

It is a truth which should make every one of us weep, that those living in these last days, upon whom the ends of the world are come, are far more guilty than was Belshazzar. This is possible in many ways. When men have taken upon themselves the vows of consecration, to devote all their powers to the sacred service of God; when they occupy the position of expositors of Bible truth, and have received the solemn charge; when God and angels are summoned as witnesses to the solemn dedication of soul, body, and spirit to God's service—then shall these men who minister in a most holy office desecrate their God-given powers to unholy purposes? Shall the sacred vessel, whom God is to use for a high and holy work, be dragged from its lofty, controlling sphere to administer to debasing lust? Is not this idol worship of the most degrading kind?—the lips uttering praises and adoring a sinful human being, pouring forth expressions of ravishing tenderness and adulation which belong alone to God—the powers given to God in solemn consecration administering to a harlot; for any woman who will allow the addresses of another man than her husband, who will listen to his advances, and whose ears will be pleased with the outpouring of lavish words of affection, of adoration, of endearment, is an adulteress and a harlot."},{"refcode_short":"TM 435.1","refcode_long":"Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, p. 435.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"No misfortune is so great as to become the worshiper of a false god.

There are in our time continual repetitions of Belshazzar's feast and Belshazzar's worship; and Belshazzar's sin is repeated when the heart, which God requires to be given to Him in pure and holy devotion, is turned away from Him to worship a human being, and the lips are made to utter words of praise and adoration which belong alone to the Lord God of heaven. When the affections God claims to cluster about Him are made to center upon earthly objects,—a woman, a man, or any earthly things,—God is superseded by the object which enchains the senses and affections, and the powers which were solemnly dedicated to God are bestowed upon a human being who is defiled with sin. Men and women who once bore the image of God, but are lost by disobedience and sin, He means to restore again through their becoming partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is in the world through lust.

The mission of the two anointed ones is to communicate light and power to God's people. It is to receive blessing for us that they stand in God's presence.

Bicycles were being purchased by our young people in Battle Creek, not to provide needed transportation to work or school, but rather as a demonstration of superiority, for show, and in the seeking of supremacy. The young people were mortgaging their incomes for months in advance to buy what was then an expensive piece of equipment to be so used.

Rhodes was especially pleased with the plan outlined for operating a mission among the natives of that country, and handed to Elder Robinson a sealed letter addressed to Dr. Jemison, secretary of the company, to be given to him in Bulawayo. The brethren went to Bulawayo expecting to purchase land, and did not know until Jemison told them that Rhodes had ordered him to give them all the land they wanted. A tract of twelve thousand acres was selected, and this became the site of the Solusi Mission, the first one operated by the denomination among non-Christian peoples. A knowledge of this gift created considerable concern among certain leading brethren at Battle Creek, who feared that to accept it would be a violation of the principles of the separation of church and state.
