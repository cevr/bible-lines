There is nothing that we need to preserve so sacredly as this standard of doctrine, a “Thus saith the Lord.” This is the pure fountain from which we are to draw the reasons for our faith. The Bible is our guide and textbook. The law of God is our covenant with our Maker, in life, in death, in the resurrection, and through all eternity. Our loyalty to God in obeying, in spirit and letter, the ten commandments, reveals to the world, to angels, and to men, our covenant relation with Him. Adam and Eve were to glorify God by personal and perpetual obedience to His law, and it is in this way that we are to give God glory for all His entrusted gifts.

As the workers till the soil, they are to reap all the advantages possible by making an application of the lessons they receive.

The human heart is God's seed plot, and the righteousness of Christ must be cherished there. Then let no man trust in the arm of flesh, but in God. Let each give evidence that he has faith, that he is not a religious dwarf, but that he grows under the dews and showers of the grace of Christ, that his life of righteousness is not of man's creating, but that it is the righteousness of Christ, which the grace of God has nourished in his heart."},{"refcode_short":"18MR 7.2","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 18 [Nos. 1301-1359], p. 7.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"To some the Lord has given a special work, in bearing testimonies of warning and reproof, to break down the strongholds of iniquity, to arouse conviction in the human heart, and bring man to repentance. Some messages come as the Lord's hammer, to break down the workings of Satan, and bring men to the living God. But mingled with this decided work of standing in defense of the truth is Christ's consolation, which comes when repentance reveals what sin really is.

Others fill their place as they work in retirement, feeling themselves little and unknown, with but few to recognize their work, and none to pity their mistakes and praise their victories. But the Lord uses all these elements. No one man can fill every place, and God's great work must go forward. Those who consider themselves the least, and in their weakness lean upon God, those who walk in humility of mind, as children—these will become first, and the first last.

However, on October 7, 1882, at Healdsburg, California, she was instantly healed and restored from what she and others thought was her last illness. Of this experience she declared: “About a year after the death of my husband, I was very feeble, and it was feared that I might live but a short time. At the Healdsburg camp meeting, I was taken into the tent where there was a large gathering of our people. I asked to be raised up from the lounge on which I was lying, and assisted to the speaker's platform, that I might say a few words of farewell to the people. As I tried to speak, the power of God came upon me, and thrilled me through and through. Many in the congregation observed that I was weak, and that my face and hands seemed bloodless; but as I began speaking they saw the color coming into my lips and face, and knew that a miracle was being wrought in my behalf. I stood before the people healed, and spoke with freedom.”—Selected Messages 1:54. Her secretary in later years, C. C. Crisler, adds: “The large congregation witnessed the healing. All noticed the change in her voice, and many observed the change in her countenance. They saw the sudden transition from a deathlike paleness to the flush of health, as the natural color was seen, first in her neck, then in the lower part of the face, and then in the forehead. One of the business men of healdsburg exclaimed, ‘A miracle is being wrought in sight of this whole congregation!’ After the meeting she testified to inquiring friends that the Lord had healed her.”—Life Sketches of Ellen G.

This, you know, is natural to do when the soul is letting loose its grasp of this life and looking into the eternal world. If anyone ever has a distinct view of his own imperfections, it is at this point in his experience.

The blessing of the Lord came upon me, and I spoke in the demonstration of the Spirit of God and with power. There are those who are working out a great circle. The Lord has given Christ to the world for ministry. Merely to preach the Word is not ministry. The Lord desires His ministering servants to occupy a place worthy of the highest consideration. In the mind of God, the ministry of men and women existed before the world was created. He determined that His ministers should have a perfect exemplification of Himself and His purposes. No human career could do this work; for God gave Christ in humanity to work out His ideal of what humanity may become through entire obedience to His will and way. God's character was revealed in the life of His Son. Christ not only held a theory of genuine ministry, but in His humanity He wrought out an illustration of the ministry that God approves. Perfection has marked out every feature of true ministry. Christ, the Son of the living God, did not live unto Himself, but unto God."}]
