Our brethren at Battle Creek are, many of them, embarrassed and I should feel pained to see one upon the floor.” I knew it was not the money in the thing that he cared for, but the act of the church in their thoughtfulness, and a token of their love and care; for on that very journey he had given away three hundred dollars. He paid fifty for Brother Andrews’ clothes, and was happy to do it. It was not covetousness, but a childish feeling as though he should prize such a favor of love. He did not think of this at first himself. A sister whom we all respect, suggested to him that she thought we would find it thus. But now as things have come around, the carpet given as it has been at this time, we decline receiving it. If you have not paid for it, please take it back with the excuse that we fear our health will not admit of our locating at B.C. and it would be difficult to transport. Money or presents we crave not; but when you have all the evidence that God has been pleased to give you that He has wrought for us, we want you to live so near to God that you can cooperate with us heartily, and express in words that all may understand that you do not sympathize with the wrong, that you will be with the right.

My heart was nearly broken; yet all would bring to me all the disagreeable features in his case, which drove me nearly to insanity. I tried at Brother Abbey’s to agonize with God in his behalf, but Brother Andrews thought it was only injuring him. He must act himself, he thought. He sincerely viewed matters thus, but not correctly. Had all his brethren, with true hearts, not regarding iniquity in their hearts, prayed more, afflicted their own souls, and talked less, God would have been better pleased. The time when the church was guilty of sin was when my husband attempted to act upon the testimony God had given, and started out in his feebleness to go to Wright in the cold winter. Then Satan stirred up the feelings and there was a separation in the feelings and interest from us; and our friends became our enemies. They were of that class Paul calls False Brethren, which placed us in great perils than we have ever experienced in our lives. If it had been an enemy that had done this then we could have borne it, but it was our familiar friends that had sat at our table and walked with us to the house of God."},{"refcode_short":"2LtMs, Lt 13, 1869, par. 21","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 2 (1869 - 1875), Lt 13, 1869, par. 21","content":"Your zeal at Battle Creek to present matters before Brother Andrews in the strongest light stirred him to feel and act.

Brother Andrews believed you sincere when you made your strong statements with such pious looks, and apparently grieved, oppressed hearts, how much you had borne and done for Brother and Sister White, and yet they did not appreciate it. Brother Andrews looked upon you as greatly wronged, when you were Satan’s agents working out the evil he had concocted to compass our ruin and silence our voices in the work and cause of God. You strong women were a host on Satan’s side. Brother Andrews was deceived and he moved strangely. He set the case of my husband before other ministers, and they see the case as these women and Brother Andrews set before them. God did not lead Brother Andrews in the matter of withholding the credentials, but the mistake of these others must bear the greatest share.

I do not think you came with the right feelings or with the right spirit. It seems you had been talking over matters in regard to Father, and given your version of things, feelings had kindled in your breast which you were not authorized to have and should not have allowed there in regard to your father.

Your branching out so largely involves great expense and you will, I have no doubt, be disappointed in your returns. Your income will not warrant or meet the outlays. Brother McDearmon cannot afford to hire help as you have done, for experience has taught him it will not pay. Your father has seen this from the commencement; so have I.

If you cannot do anything to help him, don’t require help of him. If you will calculate right, you can live well; but if you have two or three hired hands eating at your table and taking of your means at the amount of from thirty to fifty dollars per month, you would need an independent fortune to rely upon.

Then when you bring discouragement upon your father you weaken his power to do good in the work and cause of God.

Money is a blessing when those who use it consider that they are the Lord’s stewards, that they are handling the Lord’s capital, and must one day give account of their stewardship. It is the love of money which the Bible condemns as the root of all evil—such love that when a man loses money the precious life God has given him is made of no account because money is gone. Money is a precious gift of God, to be received gratefully and used discreetly with all fidelity.

Can Jesus say to these girls, who neglect their duty and make burdens for others by their heedlessness, “Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things”? [Matthew 25:23.] Christ will not commend any for faithfulness unless they have earned this commendation by diligent use of their privileges and the faithful discharge of their duty. The sin of the slothful servant was not because of his great vileness and unsurpassed wickedness, but he was neglectful in doing the work he ought to have done. His sin was in not doing. He was a slothful servant and lost all because he did not do the things he might have done. He neglected to perform the everyday duties of life.

Upon this vitality depends mental and muscular power. You, my brother, have not cultivated your facility to labor physically or mentally. Some men accomplish double what others do, not because they have greater vitality than others, but they have improved their ability. Use and habit has given them facility to enable them to do more in a given time than others who have taken matters easy. You have not been a man who has bowed your shoulders to take on and bear burdens. You can now do to advantage a trifle in the work and cause of God, because you lack the education essential for such a work. You have been very slow to develop your powers of physical and mental strength with practical, good results."},{"refcode_short":"2LtMs, Lt 26, 1873, par. 6","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 2 (1869 - 1875), Lt 26, 1873, par. 6","content":"Objects in life, if gained, must be worked for.

There is no virtue in Emma being like a greased rug in regard to moral power. To be so yielding and so pliable, resisting no wrong influence, but setting up her will when her course is questioned, when self is to be denied, or when self-sacrifice is required, is not the thing. The trouble is that Emma has just given herself up to follow inclination, and has no moral power to stand in integrity for the right, because the course of sin is more pleasant to the carnal heart than to battle with her own natural inclinations and subdue her desires. Oh, that she would set her heart in the right direction! Why, Emma, your life is a blank as you have been. If you do not resist Satan and feel that God has laid upon you a work—as He surely has done—to resist the temptations of Satan, you will fail of everlasting life.

After a short discourse, change the order of the exercises, and give opportunity for all who desire it to remain for an afterinterview, or Bible class, where they can ask questions upon subjects that trouble them. You will find great success in coming close to the people in these Bible lessons. The workers who labor in connection with the minister should make special efforts patiently and kindly to lead inquirers to an understanding of the truth. If you have not more than one to instruct, that one, thoroughly convinced, will communicate the light to others.

The state of the heart regulates the life.

No woman is qualified for such a place who has not the qualities to educate to obedience two children of her own."},{"refcode_short":"2LtMs, Ms 8, 1875, par. 63","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 2 (1869 - 1875), Ms 8, 1875, par. 63","content":"This may seem hard, but I can work only as God has pressed me to it.

Parents who neglect to do their duty in training their children in youth to useful labor have not true love for them. The happiest people are the most industrious, and great dangers may be escaped in youth as well as in afterlife by educating our children to useful labor. The father and mother must be united in this work of disciplining and training. Causes and results of present training should be candidly considered. The children need not be overtaxed in anxiety to teach them. The overtaxation and drain upon the system is far greater, and productive of worse results, in listless indolence. The muscles were made for use, not inaction. The muscles strengthen by use. Aptness and ability to do things come by repeated efforts. Children will have a hard enough time at best, if parents do their utmost to help them with their influence and support them with their greater experience."}]
