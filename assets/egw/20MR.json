Why need anyone be ignorant of God's remedies—hot water fomentations and cold and hot compresses? It is important to become familiar with the benefit of dieting in case of sickness.

All these subjects are treated upon in our health literature. Why not see if you cannot get them to read and become intelligent on these subjects? Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. Why should not those who are accepting the light of present truth become intelligent upon the subjects which concern the habitation the Lord has given them, walking in the light as it shines upon their pathway?

Must I be dependent on it that when I let it alone I am in this condition? Now I know that its effects are bad. I will use it no more. I have not used it since, and I feel better every day.

They may ask the Lord to heal them, but will He who caused the light to shine out of darkness heal them of that which is the result of not heeding the light, but continuing to eat, drink, and dress unhealthfully? Shall we not seek to do all that is possible for us to do by placing ourselves in the right relation to health reform?

I was so weary, having just come from the Portland camp meeting and having labored very hard while there, that I was in no condition to have such matters brought before me. It takes so long for our leading brethren to read beneath the surface that I feared that perhaps I had said something which would have been better deferred in regard to the publishing work in Nashville being conducted as separate and independent from the work in Battle Creek. So often the same old difficulties arise and are presented in regard to disturbing the “regular lines.” But God will work in some way to make His people understand that the regular lines have become full of irregular practices. [The phrase “regular lines” referred to the publishing work at Battle Creek. The “irregular practices” included the exercise of kingly authority (PM 132), the printing of “The Soul-Destroying Theories of Romanism” (Testimonies for the Church 8:92), and a variety of other improprieties. (See The Publishing Ministry, 127-178.) Meanwhile, in 1894, Ellen White's son, Edson, had begun a privately supported ministry for the blacks in Mississippi and Tennessee. Edson's sacrificial publishing ventures in the South, while independent of the “regular lines,” received Ellen White's strong sympathy and support.]"},{"refcode_short":"20MR 143.1","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 20 [Nos. 1420-1500], p. 143.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"How many more years will it be before our brethren receive the clear, keen perception which calls evil evil, and good good?

Do not urge upon them any special doctrine, but point them to Jesus as a sin-pardoning Saviour. Angels of God will make impressions on the human mind.

With a sense of God's pure truth in his heart and mind, he is better qualified to perform critical operations which mean life or death to the afflicted ones. A personal religion is essential for every physician if he would be successful in watching the diseased. He needs a power greater than his own intuition and skill.

If I had not heretofore been most thoroughly disgusted with pork, I should have been now. I could scarcely refrain from vomiting.

She pushed him with violence into the seat, bringing his head with considerable force against the back of the seat, really hurting the lad. Then came screech after screech, equaled only by the screaming engine. This mother threatened him, but to no purpose. He was in for a regular war cry. When he became tired out, then he lowered his voice to the monotonous long-drawn-out drawling cry just for the purpose of being persevering and revengeful.

The two engines puff and blow as if requiring a powerful effort to breathe. At length the summit is reached and the descent begins two miles west of Sherman. We cross Dale Creek bridge. It looks frail, as if incapable of sustaining the ponderous train, but it is built of iron and very substantial. A beautiful, narrow, silvery stream is winding its way in the depths below.

You need not take this extra burden upon you, for God is not in it. We have no men to whom we can look to manage such an institution.

Some might take these statements as verity and truth, but I knew that they were not correct, for the practice of both systems and their results had been laid open before me, and I knew that the statements that he made were not correct.
