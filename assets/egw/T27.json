Abraham was considered an old man even in his generation. The ardor of his youth had faded away. It was no longer easy for him to endure hardships and brave dangers.

The Lord spoke unto him, saying, “Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and offer him for a burnt-offering.” The heart of the old man stood still with horror. The loss of such a son by disease would have been most heart-rending to the fond father, it would have bowed his whitened head with sorrow; but now he is commanded to shed the precious blood of that son with his own hand.

He grasped the staff of faith, and in dumb agony, took his child by the hand, beautiful in the rosy health of youth, and went out to obey the word of God.

Every transgression will bring its punishment. Worldly love of gain desecrates the Sabbath, yet the claims of that holy day are not abrogated or lessened.

All hindrances will vanish before an earnest desire and persistent effort to do the will of God at any cost to self, even if life itself is sacrificed.

They went, and after forty days returned from their search, and came before Moses and Aaron, and all the congregation of Israel, and showed them the fruit of the land. All agreed that it was a good land, and they exhibited the rich fruit which they had brought as evidence. One cluster of grapes was so large that two men earned it between them on a staff. They also brought of the figs, and the pomegranates, which grew there in abundance. After they had spoken of the fertility of the land, all but two spoke very discouragingly of their being able to possess it. They said that the people were very strong that dwelt in the land, and the cities were surrounded with great and high walls, and, more than all this, they saw the children of the giant Anak there.

They did not wait, and reflect, and reason that God, who had brought them out thus far, would certainly give them the land. They left God out of the question. They acted as though in the taking of the city of Jericho, the key to the land of Canaan, they must depend solely on the power of arms. God had declared that he would give them the country, and they should have fully trusted him to fulfill his word. But their unsubdued hearts were not in harmony with his plans.

They not only accused Moses of deception, but also God, in promising a land which they were not able to possess.

Caleb reminded the people that by the covenant of God the land was insured to Israel. But their hearts were filled with madness and they would hear no more.

Moses now arose from his humiliating position and entered the tabernacle, to commune with God. Then the Lord proposed to immediately destroy this rebellious people. He desired to make of Moses a greater nation than Israel; but the meek leader of his people would not consent to this proposition. “And Moses said unto the Lord, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them; and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land, for they have heard that thou, Lord, art among this people, that thou, Lord, art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, by daytime in a pillar of cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.

He also decreed that, as a punishment for their rebellion, all the adults who left Egypt, with the exception of Caleb and Joshua, should be forever excluded from Canaan. They had utterly failed to keep their promise of obedience to God, and this released him from the covenant that they had so repeatedly violated.

You both need to acquire a habit of self-government, that your thoughts may be brought into subjection to the Spirit of Christ. It is the grace of God that you need in order that your thoughts may be disciplined to flow in the right channel, that the words you utter may be right words, and that your passions and appetites may be subject to the control of reason, and the tongue be bridled against levity and unhallowed censure and fault-finding. “If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.” The greatest triumph given to us by the religion of Christ is control over ourselves.

Those who have fallen under temptation and have backslidden from God need help. This class is represented in the lessons of Christ, by the lost sheep. The shepherd left the ninety and nine in the wilderness and hunted for the one lost sheep until he found it and returned with it on his shoulder with rejoicing. Also in the illustration of the woman who searched for the lost piece of silver until she found it, and called together her neighbors to rejoice with her that the lost was found. The connection of heavenly angels with the Christian's work is here brought clearly to light. There is more joy in the presence of the angels in Heaven over one sinner that repents than over ninety and nine just persons who need no repentance. There is joy with the Father and with Christ.

To attain this end they must become regular in their habits, and adopt a healthful system of living. Many are continually complaining and suffering from various indispositions. The reason is almost always because they do not labor wisely nor observe the laws of health. They frequently remain too much indoors, occupying heated rooms filled with impure air.

This is a glaring error, for at such times it is the duty of the minister to use his entire strength in pushing forward the cause of God. His mind should be clear and centered upon the one object of saving souls. Should his thoughts be pre-occupied with other subjects, many might be lost to the cause who could have been saved by his timely instruction. Some ministers are easily diverted from their work. They become discouraged or are attracted to their homes, and leave a growing interest to die for want of attention. The harm done the cause in this way can scarcely be estimated. When an effort to promulgate the truth is started, the minister in charge should feel the responsibility on him to carry it through successfully. If his labors appear to be without result, he should seek by earnest prayer to discover if his labors are what they should be.
