At times workers were sent into the field on the basis that having arrived, they would be self-sustaining. Arthur G. Daniells reported that he and his wife were sent to New Zealand in 1886, equipped with a ticket to the field and an evangelistic tent, and with cautions from the General Conference president to be careful in the expenditure of means. By giving temperance lectures in various Protestant churches at $5 a night, he secured funds to get his evangelistic tent through customs and soon raised up churches with tithe-paying members. From this tithe, carefully reported to proper authorities, and with laborers' reports properly audited, he was able to sustain himself and his wife. In 1894 Elder William Thurston was sent to Brazil to open the work in Rio de Janeiro through the selling of books in the English language. It was supposed that the returns from book sales would provide support for his family. It was no easy task, as a stranger in a land where a language was spoken which he did not know, to sell English-message-filled books to a people who could not read them. In the providence of God he and his family were sustained at first by gifts of money from perfect strangers.

Do get some man and his wife who will not feel it is their first work to fill their house with children, and give to these the care and charge they should give to the churches. Do not send over here a numerous family, for this will engross half the time of the man and his wife to take care of them. Do send us true missionaries who believe the end of all things is at hand, and at this time they have a higher work than to fill their houses and hands with the little children, who in no case must be neglected. Workers, Brother Olsen, unselfish workers, who have an eye single to the glory of God; men and women who for Christ's sake, for the building up of Christ's kingdom, will keep self and animal passions under control, and give themselves unreservedly to the work! There is so much needed to be done in this crisis.—Letter 50, 1892, p. 6. (Written from Preston, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, March 12, 1892, to Elder O. A.

When one sister took her stand upon the truth her husband said, “You may give up the Seventh-day Sabbath or leave my home.” They were Wesleyans. She left home, and then her daughter, a girl of sixteen years, took her stand on the Sabbath, and the father told her to leave. The mother heard this and went home for her daughter. The husband and father said, “Well, have you decided to give up that Sabbath and come back and live with me?” She replied, “No, I came for my daughter whom you have turned out of doors.” “But what are you going to do?” he questioned. “I am going to support myself and daughter. She may help me as she can.” He begged on his knees for his wife to give up these terrible doctrines. She had been a very timid woman, but the truth made her strong, and she said, “No, I shall never give up the Sabbath. I shall keep it as long as I live. I must obey God.” “Well,” he said, “if you will come back, you and my daughter may keep the Sabbath, but promise you will not go to the meetings.” She would make no such promise. “I will be a faithful wife to you in everything,” she said, “but should I listen to your proposals, and disobey God, I should not be a faithful child to Him, and therefore should not be a faithful wife to you or a faithful mother to my children.” “Well,” he said, “I am in great distress of mind. Will you go to our minister and talk with him?” At first she refused, saying that she knew her duty and need not go to the minister to learn it. But as he continued to entreat her, she finally consented. It was then ten o'clock at night. They roused up the minister, and the man laid the whole matter before him—how he had turned his wife out of doors because she had kept the Sabbath. “Now,” said he, “did I do right in this and in saying to my daughter that if she kept the Sabbath she could not stay in my house? I want you to tell me, did I do right in thus treating my wife?” The minister answered, “You did perfectly right under the circumstances.” The man responded with much vehemence, “No, I did not do right. I abused my wife, and was unkind and abusive to my child. I see now how shameful was my course in treating a woman, the mother of my children, in so heartless a manner.” He then asked the forgiveness of his wife and said she should come back to his house. No restrictions should be placed upon her. She should be at liberty to do as she thought right. He felt greatly troubled over the course he had taken. So the wife was reinstated in her own home, more respected and loved than before this fiery opposition broke upon her. Our brethren think that the husband will be converted to the truth.—Manuscript 5, 1894, 3, 4.

Said the angel, “This is an offense to God. How can God regard Himself as honored by a people who profess to worship Him, and let His blessing rest upon the people, while these things are going on?” Well, now, I could not at the time understand what this meant; but since I have come right here upon the premises, I understand it. Here is a blacksmith right here upon the premises who carries his work on right while worship is going on here on the Sabbath day. And while these meetings have been going on I have heard the same sounds that the angel caused me to hear over in America. I have heard the sound of chisel and hammer while we have been worshiping God. And the angel said to me that God could not let His blessing rest upon a people who have so little respect for His Word.

Had he said, “It is a very small matter whether I pray in secret or whether I pray openly to God and it is convenient for me to obey the command,” then the Lord could not have let His blessing rest upon him in such a remarkable degree. But here is wherein Daniel saw God could be honored; that he, as a representative of God, must keep the living God exalted above all as the One who could give wisdom and power. Here was an opportunity for him to show to all from whence came his strength, and that man could not come in between him and his God; therefore he did not accommodate himself to the circumstances at all, but he placed himself in the position that he would lose his life rather than dishonor the God of heaven in any way.

He saw to the end of that which was to be abolished when type should meet antitype in Jesus Christ. In consequence of the transgression of the law of God, death was introduced into the world. The slain lamb typified the Lamb of God that was to take away the sin of the world. The full significance of the typical offerings pointing to Christ was unfolded to Moses.

The law itself would have no glory were it not that Christ is embodied in it. The revelation of Jesus Christ cast its glory back into the Jewish age. The law had no power to save. It was lusterless, except as Christ was represented in the law as the One full of righteousness and truth. And when Christ was revealed in His advent to our world, and died man's sacrifice, type met antitype.

It is left in piles along the roadside, to be taken off in a cart. There is seldom much dust flying, because of the care taken of the roads, and this is seen in Europe everywhere.

The appearance of these rocks is as though some great temple once stood there and their massive pillars were left standing as witnesses of their former greatness. There is a rock called Giant's Club, and in proportion it is a giant. It rises almost perpendicularly and it is impossible to climb up its steep sides. This is one of nature's curiosities. I was told that its composition bears evidence of its once having been located in the bottom of a lake. This rock has regular strata, all horizontal, containing fossils of plants and of fish and curiously shaped specimens of sea animals. The plants appear like our fruit and forest trees. There are ferns and palms. The fishes seem to be of a species now extinct. A large flat stone was shown us in which were distinct specimens of fish and curious leaves. The proprietor told us, on a previous trip, that he brought these two large rocks on horseback eight miles. The rock did not look so far, but he said that was the distance to get access to it.

We need the Holy Spirit and assurance. Living power must attend the message of Christ's second coming in the clouds of heaven. We must not rest until we see many souls converted to the blessed hope of the Lord's appearing. The message wrought a real work that turned souls from idols to serve the living God. The work to be done today is just as real, and the truth is just as much truth; only we are to give the message with as much more earnestness as the coming of the Lord is nearer. The message for this time is positive, simple, and of the deepest importance. We must act like men and women who believe. We are not half awake to the perils and the dangers that we must be prepared to meet. Waiting, watching, working, praying, warning the world—this is our work.—Letter 150, 1902, pp. 2, 3. (To Prof. C.

They should not be in a busy excitement like worldlings, and become surfeited and drunken with the cares of this life. A drunken man is bewildered. The fine organs of the brain are beclouded.
