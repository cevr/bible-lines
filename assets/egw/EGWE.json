With the work of Seventh-day Adventist developing in Europe in the late 1860's and in the 1870's it was quite natural that she should be invited to spend some time in the Old World, traveling to the churches for meetings, attending and preaching at the conferences, and helping to build strength and endurance into the growing organization."},{"refcode_short":"EGWE 5.3","refcode_long":"Ellen G.

This culminated in a hearty affirmative response on the part of European publishing leaders and church administrators assembled at Jonkoping, Sweden, in 1971, to the suggestion that a historical study might be prepared that would bring those eventful days back to life again for all to enjoy. To accomplish this, arrangements were made with D. A. Delafield, an associate secretary of the White Estate, who visited the scenes of Ellen White's labors in Europe while on a year-long itinerary.

Sometimes she reported to the church in America by way of articles in its two leading english papers, the Review and Herald and the Signs of the Times. Many of her sermons preached during the two years were reported stenographically, and copies in typewritten form are on file in the White Estate office.

Two goals were kept in mind in the preparation of this record. One, the building of a correct and much-needed historical source book of an important period in the work of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Europe, thus gathering together into one framework the chronological story of Mrs. White's two years there. And, two, the telling in a limited way of the human-interest story of the personal experiences, hopes, triumphs, despairs, vicissitudes, and feelings of an altogether human person, presenting a readable account, hopefully leaving the reader with the feeling that he now knows Ellen G.

With his headquarters in Switzerland, Elder Andrews labored from the autumn of 1874 till the autumn of 1883. The witness of Andrews in Europe marked the merging of two forces: first, the most earnest appeals from Sabbathkeeping Adventists residing in Switzerland for the assistance and cooperation of the General Conference in sending to them a minister; and second, the growing conviction on the part of church leaders that one of their number should be sent from the New World to the Old World to cooperate with the European brethren in developing a European constituency."},{"refcode_short":"EGWE 17.2","refcode_long":"Ellen G.

In the process, of course, he discovered quite the opposite, and he was forced to admit that the Biblical arguments favored the seventh-day Sabbath, but even so, he still felt he could not accept Mrs. White's visions as authentic. Then came a significant meeting at Buck's Bridge, New York, in 1857. Daniel was there, and during the meeting Ellen White was taken off in open vision. The physical phenomena characterizing her early visions, among which was breathlessness (see Daniel 10:17, 18), were apparent on this occasion."},{"refcode_short":"EGWE 58.1","refcode_long":"Ellen G.

They were evidences among other evidences. Since Satan could presumably counterfeit the physical phenomena, there would have to be more basic tests. These tests are defined in the following scriptures: Matthew 7:15-20; Isaiah 8:20; Jeremiah 28:9; 1 John 4:1, 2.

One hundred and twenty-five delegates had been present for the organizing meeting in Bienne, but when Mrs. White rose to address the 1885 session on Friday, she was surprised and delighted to see nearly 200 believers before her. “A more intelligent, noble-looking company is seldom seen,” she reported to Review readers. “Although gathered from different nations, we were brought near to God and to one another by our eyes being fixed upon the one object, Jesus Christ.”—The Review and Herald, November 3, 1885."},{"refcode_short":"EGWE 59.2","refcode_long":"Ellen G.

The minister must be alert to any sign of interest and conviction aroused by his preaching, and he must move immediately to work personally with the people: “Many a precious soul balances for a time,” Ellen White said, “and then takes his position on the side of error, because he does not have this personal effort at the right time” (Historical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists, 148). She suggested that workers may have to reside where the people need help most: “They ought to come close to the people, sit with them at their tables and lodge in their humble homes.”—Ibid.

The work of saving souls is not to be done by the ministers alone. Every one who has been converted will seek to bring others to a knowledge of the truth. Commence to work for those in your own homes and neighborhoods.... You can also send up your petitions for the laborers in the different fields. God will hear your prayers.”—Ibid. Mrs. White's counsel represented more than mere sermonizing. As a mother with four sons, she had always labored faithfully to win to Christ those close to her and her neighbors, as well.

Then, too, the contact with the people would often be brief and superficial in an open-air meeting. It was not that they should never be held, but there were better ways to preach the message. The best way of all was for the minister to go into the homes of the people, “opening to them the Scriptures around the fireside; making plain essential points of present truth....

When they arrived, Mrs. White was experiencing sharp pains in her heart.*Ellen White had to fight her infirmities constantly, weak lungs and a weak heart. But her mind was clear and strong and her spirit indomitable. At one time she explained to Elder Loughborough that, like the Apostle Paul, she had a “thorn in the flesh”—A weak heart that frequently troubled her (The General Conference Bulletin, January 29, 1893).

She also told him of her early health-reform visions and how these visions had led her to alter her eating habits.*The most important of the health-reform visions came to her on June 6, 1863. Cautions and warnings came from the Lord, pinpointing the dangers to health present in man's diet, women's dress, and the drugging by the physicians of the time. Attention was called to a simple diet, the natural use of water, and to nature's remedies generally. Later visions provided additional light from heaven. Her five books and numerous periodical articles on the subject made Adventists the most health-conscious people in Christendom.

Recreational activities as far as she was concerned were always subordinate to the demands of the work. Yet she did take time for rest and change, and this she considered essential. (See Testimonies for the Church 1:514, 520.) The main point of interest, of course, in Milan, was the grand cathedral, the most important Gothic structure in Italy. The cathedral, begun in 1386, was just then being completed. She confessed that no one could fail to be impressed with the grandeur and immensity of the huge white-marble building, but she still looked upon it as a vast “extravagance.” Some art critics have had similar reservations about the cathedral, but her judgments were colored by factors other than mere artistic taste. While she was overwhelmed by the architecture, she was favorably impressed by “the windows and walls ... adorned with high-colored pictures, painted by the finest Italian artists.

In Britain the increase of only twenty-two believers was a cause for concern. That afternoon almost the entire time of the council was spent studying how to improve the publishing work in England. Apparently colporteurs had been trying to sell American books. Now the council resolved to secure a few of the best Adventist books and thoroughly adapt these to English readers, altering style, spelling, and references to conform to British usage. There were some differences of opinion as to whether a fully equipped printing office should be established in Britain or whether the work should be hired out, but all agreed that the headquarters of the work should be shifted from Grimsby to London as soon as possible.
