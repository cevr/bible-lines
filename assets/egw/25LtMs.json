Unless the parents are convinced that it would be for the best interests of their children to place them under the school-home discipline, they should be permitted to keep them under their own control as far as possible.

After I had talked with our people—and we had an excellent meeting, then a baptism, and then a testimony meeting—I went to talk to the colored people a few words that they wanted me to give them. But I gave them just as interesting a discourse as I did to the white people, and you should see how eagerly they grasped it, how thankful they were. “Now,” said I, “give your testimonies; we want your testimonies.” Well, they would stand right up and give a clear, nice testimony, short, or course.

Let us decide not to be channels thru which Satan shall send gloomy disagreeable thoughts. Let our words be not a savor of death unto death, but of life unto life, in the words we speak to the people and in the prayers we offer. God desires us to give unmistakable evidences that we have a spiritual life. We do not enjoy the fulness of the blessing which the Lord has prepared for us because we do not ask in faith. If we would exercise faith in the word of the living God, we should have the richest blessings. We dishonor God by our lack of faith; therefore we cannot impart life to others unless we ourselves bear a living, uplifting testimony. We cannot give that which we do not possess. If we will walk humbly with God, if we will walk in the spirit of Christ, none of us will carry heavy burdens. We shall lay them on the great burden-bearer. Then we may expect triumphs in the presence of God, in the communion of His love. Every camp meeting may be a love feast from the beginning to the end because God's presence is with His people. All heaven is interested in our salvation. The angels of God, thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand are commissioned ministers to those who shall be heirs of salvation. They guard us against evil and press back the powers of darkness that are seeking our destruction. Have we not reason to be thankful every moment; thankful even when there are apparent difficulties in our pathway. The Lord Himself is our Helper.”"},{"refcode_short":"25LtMs, Ms 79a, 1910, par. 28","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 25 (1910 - 1915), Ms 79a, 1910, par. 28","content":"“Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem."},{"refcode_short":"25LtMs, Ms 79a, 1910, par. 29","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 25 (1910 - 1915), Ms 79a, 1910, par. 29","content":"“The Lord hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy; the King of Israel, even the Lord, is in the midst of thee; thou shalt not see evil any more."},{"refcode_short":"25LtMs, Ms 79a, 1910, par. 30","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 25 (1910 - 1915), Ms 79a, 1910, par. 30","content":"“In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not; and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack."},{"refcode_short":"25LtMs, Ms 79a, 1910, par. 31","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 25 (1910 - 1915), Ms 79a, 1910, par. 31","content":"“The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; He will save, He will rejoice over thee with joy; He will rest in His love, He will joy over thee with singing.” Zephaniah 3:14-17."},{"refcode_short":"25LtMs, Ms 79a, 1910, par. 32","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 25 (1910 - 1915), Ms 79a, 1910, par. 32","content":"This is the testimony that the Lord desires to bear to the world.

You cannot neglect things here; you cannot do that; but you can find opportunities where you can let the light of this institution shine forth. God wants you to do it. I believe that you will try to do it. What we want is a greater work of faith that we may show forth the praises of God in what He is doing and what He will do for us. If we will show this faith, it will have as much influence as any treatment you can give to those who are looking on to see what we are doing. Let us get into the position where we will lay all on Jesus Christ, for there is a grand review to take place; only a little while and there is to be an examination of what we believe and what we are.

Young men and young women, teachers, doctors, do not put on pompous (manners) positions, as tho you knew everything worth knowing, but act as little children coming to ask God to let His blessing rest upon you, that you may teach others; for if you do that the will of God will be revealed and it will follow you wherever you go.

The way of salvation is so simple that a little child can understand it. We are to follow on to know the Lord; and as we daily follow His leadings, we shall learn that His goings forth are prepared as the morning. Christ did not come to earth to sit on a throne and rule the nations. He came as a humble man to be tempted and to overcome temptation and to follow on, as we must, to know the Lord. In a study of His life we shall see how much God through Christ has done for men. And we shall see that however great our sufferings and trials may be, they cannot exceed what Christ endured that we might know the way, the truth, and the life. We are to show our appreciation for God’s great sacrifice by a life of conformity to Christ’s example. Living thus, we shall not lose any of the benefits brought to the world through Him."},{"refcode_short":"25LtMs, Ms 11, 1911, par. 7","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 25 (1910 - 1915), Ms 11, 1911, par. 7","content":"I would say to these students, Never feel that you need not be particular in your Christian experience; for you can never enter the kingdom of heaven until you represent in your life the life of Christ, until you have learned the need of living every hour in and through Christ.

The Auditing Committee has often been composed of men who were farmers. These could dress in coarse clothing appropriate for the work they were doing. They raised all they needed as a family to subsist upon, and they knew not what the outlay of a minister must necessarily be when he goes into a new field to labor for perishing souls. The outlook is often hard and discouraging. Some fields, when the work is first opened up, are encouraging; but there are other fields which are not so. Both must receive the truth. The minister must labor and pray. He must visit the different families. Frequently he finds the people so poor that they have little to eat and no room in which to sleep. Often means have to be given to the very needy to supply their hunger and cover their nakedness. Then what injustice to have a company of men as Auditing Committee who, by a dash of the pen, will disappoint a distressed minister who is in need of every cent that he has been led to expect.
