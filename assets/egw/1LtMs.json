By the letter you would like to know whether I had light on the Bridegroom’s coming before I saw it in vision. I can readily answer, No. The Lord showed me the travel of the Advent band and midnight cry in December, but He did not show me the Bridegroom’s coming until February following. Perhaps you would like to have me give a statement in relation to both visions. At the time I had the vision of the midnight cry I had given it up in the past and thought it future, as also most of the band had. I know not what time J. Turner got out his paper. I knew he had one out and one was in the house, but I knew not what was in it, for I did not read a word in it. I had been, and still was very sick. I took no interest in reading, for it injured my head and made me nervous. After I had the vision and God gave me light, He bade me deliver it to the band, but I shrank from it. I was young, and I thought they would not receive it from me. I disobeyed the Lord, and instead of remaining at home, where the meeting was to be that night, I got in a sleigh in the morning and rode three or four miles and there I found J. T. He merely inquired how I was and if I was in the way of my duty. I said nothing, for I knew I was not. I passed up chamber and did not see him again for two hours, when he came up, asked if I was to be at meeting that night. I told him, no. He said he wanted to hear my vision and thought it duty for me to go home. I told him I should not. He said no more, but went away. I thought, and told those around me, if I went I should have to come out against his views, thinking he believed with the rest. I had not told any of them what God had shown me, and I did not tell them in what I should cut across his track."},{"refcode_short":"1LtMs, Lt 3, 1847, par. 4","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 1 (1844 - 1868), Lt 3, 1847, par. 4","content":"All that day I suffered much in body and mind.

I suffered much at the commencement of the meeting. Unbelief seemed to be on every hand. There was one sister there that was called very spiritual. She had traveled and been a powerful preacher the most of the time for twenty years. She had been truly a mother in Israel. But a division had risen in the band on the shut door. She had great sympathy, and could not believe the door was shut. (I had known nothing of their differences.) Sister Durben [Dearborn?] got up to talk. I felt very, very sad. At length my soul seemed to be in an agony, and while she was talking I fell from my chair to the floor. It was then I had a view of Jesus rising from His mediatorial throne and going to the holiest as Bridegroom to receive His kingdom. They were all deeply interested in the view. They all said it was entirely new to them. The Lord worked in mighty power setting the truth home to their hearts. Sister Durben [Dearborn?] knew what the power of the Lord was, for she had felt it many times; and a short time after I fell she was struck down and fell to the floor, crying to God to have mercy on her. When I came out of vision, my ears were saluted with Sister Durben's [Dearborn's] singing and shouting with a loud voice. Most of them received the vision, and were settled upon the shut door. Previous to this I had no light on the coming of the Bridegroom, but had expected Him to this earth to deliver His people on the tenth day of the seventh month.

At the same time I was shown that it would be of no use for Brother Barr to travel among the churches East, for he could not do them good; that he had better be laboring in a humble way, working with his hands, than to do this; and that he possessed too much dignity, etc."},{"refcode_short":"1LtMs, Lt 19, 1859, par. 2","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 1 (1844 - 1868), Lt 19, 1859, par. 2","content":"While at Dartmouth, Mass., a few weeks since, again the power of God rested upon me and I was wrapped up in a vision of God’s glory.

I was shown that the ministers, or those who professed to be servants of God, had caused much of this sad state of things for lack of real spiritual intelligence.

But some went ahead of the angels and were burdened and exercised because the work was not closed up at once. They did not wait patiently for the Lord to test character and to spue out the lukewarm, but took that work into their own hands; and unless they could see individuals coming up to the point they thought they should reach, they pushed them off. A fear came over them—fear to associate with the ones they thought spued out of the mouth of the Lord. Why did they not read the connection—Revelation 3:18-22?

The evidence has come and it is feeling that has swallowed up the faith. This view of faith and feeling seemed to enlighten some minds and we had a most powerful conference meeting.

He seemed to understand the nature of his enemy and he dared not run by, but in a most humble manner crawled along upon the ground. Thus he continued to crouch and crawl until he had come up to the fierce-looking dog, who immediately pounced upon him. The dog would not battle but rolled upon the ground in a begging manner. The big dog could not fight alone. He left the clever, pleading animal, who was still afraid of irritating him. So he walked along slowly, acting as though he wished to run but did not dare to. At length he increased his pace a little until he was sure he could outrun the other big dog; then he ran along as fast as he could go, looking back to see if the other followed.

I see God will not do His work of spewing out until character is developed, His professed people proved, tested, and tried. Now God is proving His people to see if they will obey Him. “Be zealous ... and repent.” [Revelation 3:19.] If they will not, He will spew them out of His mouth.

In inviting them to Battle Creek the church wished to help them, and especially Mrs. Hull, to take a right course, mend her ways, and cause a reform with her. Some of Brother Hull’s letters from New York were calculated to nourish a spirit of faultfinding with her against the Knoxville church, and revive the old prejudice and jealousy against them.

You have followed your own will and projects so many times, concealing all from us, going directly contrary to all our counsel, advice, and prohibitions, that we cannot depend upon you, and this painful fact has been so evinced in your character that you are associated in my mind not with pleasant thoughts but with most painful fears and forebodings. Instead of being a comfort you are a source of painful anxiety. We are puzzled, and at times stupefied with amazement and anguish. We promise nothing in regard to you.

I have felt sometimes as though a blight had fallen over all our future prospects, as though my precious plants were already blighted. Thorns and briers have sprung up in my garden and choked the seed which I have tried to sow. You may say, “Dear me, Mother feels very keenly over trifles.

The rank and noisome weeds of falsehood and deceit, which choke the precious plants of candor and truth, are sown in the springtime of youth. They flourish in a soil too friendly to their growth, even the human unrenewed heart which God’s Word declares to be “deceitful above all things and desperately wicked.” [Jeremiah 17:9.] After indulging in deception or concealing things from your parents, prevarication comes next; which is a mean, cowardly sort of lying. The path of truth is always safe, straight, and easy; that of deceit has so many windings and turnings that one deviation from uprightness and candor may lead to a thousand deceptions which were not anticipated at the first.

There are ill-balanced minds that imagine themselves very religious and impose upon themselves rigorous fasting, which God has nothing to do with, and this is the reason that they are not sustained.

We meet with physical and mental wrecks everywhere. These started in all wrong. They gave themselves wholly to the confinement of study, neglecting physical exercise. These should be beacons of warning to others not to be presumptuous and cherish only one idea and sacrifice everything that makes life valuable to obtain knowledge, which when gained they cannot put to practical use because health has been sacrificed in their efforts.

They never reach that intellectual height they had hoped to reach. These began wrong and continued wrong. They did not mingle work with the taxation of the mental powers. The brain was overworked while other organs were left inactive. The result was the ruin of the physical and mental too. The value of health and how to preserve it should be your first study. Health is enjoyment and life. Health dedicated to God becomes the richest possession. No honor or wealth or learning will compensate for the loss of health.

Earnest Christians seek ever to imitate Jesus, for to be Christians is to be Christlike. It will be essential to have correct conceptions of Christ’s life, Christ’s habits, that His principles may be reproduced in us who would be Christlike. A half service, loving the world, loving self, loving frivolous amusements, makes a timid, cowardly servant. Such follow Christ a great way off. A hearty, willing service to Jesus produces a sunny religion. Those who follow Christ most closely have not been gloomy. In Christ is light and peace and joy forever more.

Brethren Root and Rogers have felt the weight of the cause upon them, yet there has been a fearing to move. Brother Root has felt a pressure bearing against the influence he was trying to exert in the church. When he sees things are going wrong in the church, it is his duty to speak, and it is the duty of the church to sustain him. He has felt fearful of speaking out his convictions in regard to things in the church, which looked to him as though moving wrong.

Sister Wilson should not lend her ear to these complaints, which are instigated by Satan.

Coming from such a source and in such a form, it was the most likely to corrupt a youthful mind. Joseph was saved by his religious principles, which led him promptly and firmly to resist the device of Satan. His tempter, defeated in her purpose, wickedly sought to ruin the youth whose virtues she could not corrupt, and accused Joseph of the very crime he would not commit. He was cast into prison as the price of his virtue, and for years he was confined as a criminal. But God’s eye was upon him every moment.

Although vice seemed to triumph, while virtue was trampled in the dust, Joseph did not make his lot worse by repining. He possessed genuine religion. It was this that gave him strength to resist temptation, that led him to utter the noble words, “How can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?” [Genesis 39:9.] Joseph remembered that the all-seeing eye of God was upon him. It was this that kept him from discouragement under the test of temptation and adversity. He did not foster hatred against his enemies; his sympathy with humanity was strong. He did all in his power to help and relieve the discouragement and wretchedness of the prisoners. He forgot self, and became cheerful in helping others to bear their woes.

You have been taking advantage of those things which grieve, which bring anguish upon the people of God as they see some of their numbers unconsecrated and frequently overcome by Satan. Instead of aiding in the work to help these erring souls get right, you have triumphantly made their errors conspicuous to those who hated them because they professed to keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.

There are many homes which the orphans might share and be a blessing. Although they may be a care at times, and a burden, yet this is just what many need to aid them to overcome their selfishness.

Jesus did not confine His visits and labors to a class more intelligent and less faulty, to the neglect of the unfortunate.
