In order to help in this cause, I have proposed giving my book on the parables. I feel very anxious that the General Conference shall act unselfishly in regard to this book, which is to be published to help the schools.

We shall ask that the whole field be supplied with canvassers. We shall call upon our ministers, as they visit the churches, to encourage men and women to go out as canvassers, to make a decided forward movement in the path of self-denial by giving part of their earnings to help our schools to get out of debt. Surely they can do this much to help the Master."},{"refcode_short":"PH135 3.3","refcode_long":"God’s Plan for the Relief of Avondale School, p. 3.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"A general movement is needed, but this must begin with individual movements. Let each member in each family in each church make determined efforts to deny self. Let us have the whole-hearted co-operation of all in our ranks. Let us all move forward willingly and intelligently to do what we can to relieve those of our schools that are struggling under a pressure of debt. Let the officers of each church find out who among the members has been sent to school, and helped by the school. Then let the church refund the tuition money. Let those who have had success in canvassing come up to the help of the Lord.

Let all lift harmoniously and help as much as they possibly can. Great blessings will come to those who will take hold of this matter just now. Let no discouragement be offered by our ministers, as though it were not a proper thing to do. They should take hold of this work. If they do it aright, cheerfully, hopefully, they will find it a very great blessing. The Lord does not force any man to work, but to those who will place themselves decidedly on His side, He will give a willing mind. He will bless the one who works out the spirit which He works in. God will make the movement for the help of our schools a success if it is made in a free, willing spirit, as to the Lord. Only in this way can be rolled back the reproach that has come upon our schools all over the land. If all will take hold of this work in the spirit of self-sacrifice, for Christ's sake, and for the truth's sake, it will not be long before the jubilee song of freedom can be sung through our borders."},{"refcode_short":"PH135 4.3","refcode_long":"God’s Plan for the Relief of Avondale School, p. 4.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Let our ministers consecrate themselves to God. We need so much,—O so much!—humble men, who feel it a pleasure to do their very best. A glorious gospel work opens before the converted, faithful minister. He is to help his fellow-men to a better understanding of the Word. The influence exerted by the minister with whom God works is weighty and momentous. The Lord is highly pleased with the minister who works humbly and willingly. Those who are wholly consecrated to God will ever seek wisdom from on high to enable them to bear their heavy responsibilities. They will be patient, forbearing, courteous, knowing that they are Christ's representatives. They will show a deep earnestness and fervor in prayer, and in their appeals to individuals and congregations."},{"refcode_short":"PH135 5.1","refcode_long":"God’s Plan for the Relief of Avondale School, p. 5.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Instead of becoming like the world, we are to become more and more distinct from the world. Satan has combined and will continue to combine with the churches in making a masterly effort against the truth of God. Everything that is done by God's people to make inroads upon the world will call forth determined opposition from the powers of darkness. The enemy's last great conflict will be a most determined one. It will be the last battle between the powers of darkness and the powers of light. Every true child of God will fight bravely on the side of Christ. Those who in this great crisis allow themselves to be more on the side of the world than of God will eventually place themselves wholly on the side of the world. Those who become confused in their understanding of the Word, who fail to see the meaning of antichrist, will surely place themselves on the side of antichrist. There is no time for us to assimilate with the world. Daniel is standing in his lot and in his place. The prophecies of Daniel and of John are to be understood; they interpret each other. They give to the world truths which everyone should understand. These prophecies are to be witnesses in the world. By their fulfillment in these last days, they will explain themselves."},{"refcode_short":"PH135 5.2","refcode_long":"God’s Plan for the Relief of Avondale School, p. 5.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I thought this movement on my part would provoke others to self-denial and to benevolence and mercy, to take right hold of this matter and get out “The Parables” to do this work. Well, the Lord is, I believe, willing to help us in this work. I shall only draw upon the books to give some to the poor that can not buy. W. C. White enters into this plan with great satisfaction.

As we have walked and worked by faith, God has fulfilled to us every word that He has spoken. The evidence we have of the faithfulness of His promises should check every thought of unbelief.

They came, both men and women, as many as were willing-hearted. Men came with their gifts of gold and silver, choice fabrics, and valuable wood. The rulers brought precious stones, costly spices, and oil for the lights. And all the women that were wise-hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun.

As long as we live, we are ever to bear in mind that we are bought with a price. Christ made of Himself a whole and complete sacrifice for us, to make it possible for us to receive the gift of everlasting life. “Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.” We have enlisted under Christ's banner for life service, and great responsibilities and possibilities are within our reach. There are in the providence of God particular periods when we must arise in response to the call of God, and make use of our time, our intellect, our whole being, body, soul, and spirit, fulfilling to the utmost of our ability the requirements of God. Just now let not the opportunity be lost. Let all work together. Let children act a part. Let every member of the family do something. Educate, educate. This is an opportunity which God's people can not afford to lose. God calls. Do your best at this time to render to Him your offering, to carry out His specified will; and thus make this an occasion for witnessing for Him and His truth. In a world of darkness let your light shine forth. Let canvassers do their best in canvassing for the book Christ's Object Lessons. Their work will serve a double purpose. They will place in the homes of the people a book containing most precious light, seed sown to bring truth to souls ready to perish. In receiving this seed into their hearts, they will save their souls through belief of the truth. At the same time means will be gathered for the relief of the schools.

Peace and intelligence and grace will be given. It is the design of God that we should all glorify Him, regarding His service as the chief end of our existence. The work that God calls you to do He will make a blessing to you.
