The work of the Sabbath school is not lacking in this respect.

White, that appeared through the years in the Sabbath School Worker. In 1900, many of these articles were assembled and published in a small volume, which has become well known as Testimonies on Sabbath School Work. For nearly forty years Sabbath school workers throughout the world have sought the valuable counsel of this little volume in building this important organization to the place of strength it occupies today."},{"refcode_short":"CSW 3.2","refcode_long":"Counsels on Sabbath School Work, p. 3.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Since the publication of Testimonies On Sabbath School Work, added instruction pertaining to this line of activity has appeared in the writings of Mrs. E.

Jesus says, “Without Me ye can do nothing.” This matter of choosing officers should not be left to the control of the Sabbath school scholars. To change the officers frequently will be an advantage to the school; for one man's mind is not to mold all other minds. He may have some excellent qualifications, and yet in some things be deficient. Another chosen may be efficient where the other was lacking. Different minds and qualities will bring in fresh ideas, fresh lines of thought; and this is essential. But, above everything else, select those who, in the simplicity of their souls, are walking in the truth, who love and fear God, and take their lessons in His school. Such will carry the scholars forward and upward. Under wise teachers the scholars will gain increased interest for the word of God, and have deeper insight into the Scriptures. Let Christ be the theme of every lesson. The lessons which Christ has given to His disciples are of the highest importance.—Testimonies on Sabbath-School Work, 83, 84."},{"refcode_short":"CSW 165","refcode_long":"Counsels on Sabbath School Work, p. 165 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Counsel to Superintendents"},{"refcode_short":"CSW 165.2","refcode_long":"Counsels on Sabbath School Work, p. 165.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"There is earnest work to be done in our Sabbath schools, and those who have the management of these schools should seek to move with wisdom and tact.

It absorbed the minds of the young, while other religious duties were neglected. Frequently, after the Sabbath school was closed, the superintendent, a number of teachers, and quite a number of scholars, would return home to rest. They felt that their burden for the day was ended, and that they had no further duty. When the bell sounded forth the hour for public service, and the people left their homes for the house of worship, they would meet a large portion of the school passing to their homes. And, however important the meeting, the interest of a large share of the Sabbath school could not be awakened to take any pleasure in the instruction given by the minister upon important Bible subjects. While many of the children did not attend public service, some that remained were not advantaged by the word spoken, for they felt that it was a wearisome tax.—Testimonies on Sabbath-School Work, 7."},{"refcode_short":"CSW 183","refcode_long":"Counsels on Sabbath School Work, p. 183 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Small Company Sabbath Schools"},{"refcode_short":"CSW 183.2","refcode_long":"Counsels on Sabbath School Work, p. 183.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Companies of Sabbathkeepers may be raised up in many places.

This is one of the important branches of the work, and should not be left to chance, or to haphazard management. If these schools are conducted as they should be, the efforts made in the pulpit to present the truth in a manner to win souls may be deepened; and if the labor bestowed is followed up by interested workers in the Sabbath school, much good will be accomplished. But it is not enough to have the Sabbath school move like well-regulated machinery. There should be practical workers; the teachers should be of that class who have a living connection with God, who have an appetite for study themselves, who will give time and moral earnestness to their work, and who will not be satisfied unless they see something accomplished...."},{"refcode_short":"CSW 185.1","refcode_long":"Counsels on Sabbath School Work, p. 185.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"It is important that the exercises in our camp meeting Sabbath schools be conducted with order, promptness, and efficiency.
