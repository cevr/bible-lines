As a source of inspiration and guidance to this group, the leaders of the denomination arranged to have placed in their hands the E. G. White instruction which had been directed to our writers and editors through the years, drawn from both published sources and manuscripts. This counsel and instruction was distributed to the editors in the form of a little paper-bound work entitled Counsels to Editors.

There has been an increasing call for the book by Seventh-day Adventist workers generally. Inasmuch as the writing for our journals and the production of denominational books is done largely by our worker group throughout the world, and inasmuch as our evangelists with their radio ministry are entering more and more the field of writing in the preparation of their scripts, it seems appropriate to make this volume of counsels generally available through a new edition, which is now issued as a permanent publication."},{"refcode_short":"CW 6.1","refcode_long":"Counsels to Writers and Editors, p. 6.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The reader will observe that certain of these messages speak plainly of detrimental policies and of dangers which have threatened the work.

These counsels have been a source of guidance in the work of the past, and their inclusion here should not be construed to constitute a condemnation or criticism of these publications and publishing houses today, but, rather, as cautions against a repetition of former mistakes. Some journals are mentioned which are not now issued. As an aid to the reader in identifying these, footnotes have been appended. The fields which they served are now cared for by other publications.

At this time God's message to the world is to be given with such prominence and power that the people will be brought face to face, mind to mind, heart to heart, with truth.

[The Review and Herald previous to this time had been published quite irregularly, and was now issued semimonthly.] The cause, in the time in which we are living, demands the paper weekly, and the publication of many more tracts to expose the increasing errors of this time; but the work is hindered for want of means. I saw that the truth must go, and that we must not be too fearful; that tracts and papers might better go to three where they were not needed than to have one deprived of them who prizes them, and can be benefited by them. I saw that the last-day signs should be brought out clearly, for the manifestations of Satan are on the increase.

Numberless words need not be put upon paper to justify what speaks for itself and shines in its clearness. Truth is straight, plain, clear, and stands out boldly in its own defense; but it is not so with error. It is so winding and twisting that it needs a multitude of words to explain it in its crooked form. I saw that all the light they had received in some places had come from the paper; that souls had received the truth in this way, and then talked it to others; and that now in places where there are several, they had been raised up by this silent messenger.

In the sixth chapter of John there is instruction of great importance to those who would be teachers. Let it be carefully studied by our teachers, that they may be able to give their students meat in due season. “It is written in the prophets,” said Christ, “And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto Me. Not that any man hath seen the Father, save He which is of God, He hath seen the Father. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on Me hath everlasting life. I am that bread of life. Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever: and the bread that I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world...."},{"refcode_short":"CW 121.1","refcode_long":"Counsels to Writers and Editors, p. 121.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"“Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.

By the great cleaver of truth He has cut them out from the quarry of the world, and brought them into connection with Himself. He has made them His representatives, and has called them to be ambassadors for Him in the last work of salvation. The greatest wealth of truth ever entrusted to mortals, the most solemn and fearful warnings ever sent by God to man, have been committed to them to be given to the world; and in the accomplishment of this work our publishing houses are among the most effective agencies...."},{"refcode_short":"CW 178.2","refcode_long":"Counsels to Writers and Editors, p. 178.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Startling Messages—The publications sent forth from our printing houses are to prepare a people to meet God. Throughout the world they are to do the same work that was done by John the Baptist for the Jewish nation. By startling messages of warning, God's prophet awakened men from worldly dreaming. Through him God called backsliding Israel to repentance. By his presentation of truth he exposed popular delusions. In contrast with the false theories of his time, truth in his teaching stood forth as an eternal certainty. “Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,” was John's message. This same message, through the publications from our printing houses, is to be given to the world today. The prophecy that John's mission fulfilled outlines our work,—“Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.” Matthew 3:2, 3. As John prepared the way for the first, so we are to prepare the way for the second, advent of the Saviour."},{"refcode_short":"CW 179.1","refcode_long":"Counsels to Writers and Editors, p. 179.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Exalt the Sabbath—Our publishing institutions are to exalt the claims of God's downtrodden law. Standing before the world as reformers, they are to show that the law of God is the foundation of all enduring reform. In clear, distinct lines they are to present the necessity of obedience to all His commandments. Constrained by the love of Christ, they are to co-operate with Him in building up the old waste places, raising up the foundations of many generations. They are to stand as repairers of the breach, restorers of paths to dwell in. Through their testimony the Sabbath of the fourth commandment is to stand as a witness, a constant reminder of God, to attract notice and arouse investigation that shall direct the minds of men to their Creator."},{"refcode_short":"CW 179.2","refcode_long":"Counsels to Writers and Editors, p. 179.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Herald the Three Angels’ Messages—Let it never be forgotten that these institutions are to cooperate with the ministry of the delegates of heaven.

I was shown men and women studying with intense interest papers and a few pages of tracts upon present truth. They would read the evidences so wonderful and new to them, and would open their Bibles with a deep and new interest, as subjects of truth that had been dark to them were made plain, especially the light in regard to the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. As they searched the Scriptures to see if these things were so, a new light shone upon their understanding, for angels were hovering over them, and impressing their minds with the truths contained in the publications they had been reading."},{"refcode_short":"CW 181.1","refcode_long":"Counsels to Writers and Editors, p. 181.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"A Harvest of Precious Souls—I saw them holding papers and tracts in one hand, and the Bible in the other, while their cheeks were wet with tears; and bowing before God in earnest, humble prayer, to be guided into all truth,—the very thing He was doing for them before they called upon Him. And when the truth was received in their hearts, and they saw the harmonious chain of truth, the Bible was to them a new book; they hugged it to their hearts with grateful joy, while their countenances were all aglow with happiness and holy joy. These were not satisfied with merely enjoying the light themselves, and they began to work for others. Some made great sacrifices for the truth's sake and to help those of the brethren who were in darkness.—Life Sketches, 214-215 (1915)."}]
