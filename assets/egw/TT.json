The acts recorded in this remarkable book are in the truest sense the acts of the Spirit. At Pentecost the praying disciples were filled with the Spirit and preached the gospel with power. When the church suffered intensely at the hands of Roman and Jewish persecutors, it was the Spirit who sustained the believers and kept them from error."},{"refcode_short":"TT 5.3","refcode_long":"From Trials to Triumph, p. 5.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The future will witness a bestowal of spiritual power exceeding that of Pentecost.

Ephesians 3:10."},{"refcode_short":"TT 9.2","refcode_long":"From Trials to Triumph, p. 9.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Many and wonderful are the promises in the Scriptures regarding the church. “Mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.” “I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages; that thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Show yourselves.” “Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.” Isaiah 56:7; 49:8, 9, l5."},{"refcode_short":"TT 9.3","refcode_long":"From Trials to Triumph, p. 9.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The church is God's fortress, His city of refuge, which He holds in a revolted world. Any betrayal of the church is treachery to Him who has bought mankind with the blood of His only-begotten Son. From the beginning, faithful souls have constituted the church. In every age the Lord's watchmen have borne a faithful testimony to the generation in which they lived. God has sent forth His angels to minister to His church, and the gates of hell have not been able to prevail against His people. Not one opposing force has risen to counterwork His work, that God has not foreseen. He has not left His church forsaken, but has traced in prophetic declarations what would occur. All His purposes will be fulfilled. Truth is inspired and guarded by God, and it will triumph over all opposition."},{"refcode_short":"TT 10.1","refcode_long":"From Trials to Triumph, p. 10.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Enfeebled and defective as it may appear, the church is the one object on which God bestows His supreme regard.

To the ancient Egyptian nation God made Joseph a fountain of life. Through him that whole people was preserved. Through Daniel God saved the life of all the wise men of Babylon. These deliverances illustrate the spiritual blessings offered the world through the God whom Joseph and Daniel worshiped.

They had once known Him; but because “they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, ... their foolish heart was darkened.” Romans 1:21. Yet God did not blot them out. He purposed to give them opportunity to become acquainted with Him through His chosen people. Through the sacrificial service, Christ was to be uplifted, and all who would look to Him should live.

Day by day He taught them, sometimes sitting on the mountainside, sometimes beside the sea or walking by the way. He did not command the disciples to do this or that, but said, “Follow Me.” On His journeys through country and cities, He took them with Him. They shared His frugal fare and like Him were sometimes hungry and often weary. They saw Him in every phase of life."},{"refcode_short":"TT 12.3","refcode_long":"From Trials to Triumph, p. 12.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The ordination of the Twelve was the first step in the organization of the church. The record says, “He ordained twelve, that they should be with Him, and that He might send them forth to preach.” Mark 3:14.

He slept under their roofs, ate at their tables, and taught in their streets."},{"refcode_short":"TT 13.2","refcode_long":"From Trials to Triumph, p. 13.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The Saviour longed to unfold to His disciples the truth that “the Gentiles should be fellow heirs” with the Jews and “partakers of His promise in Christ by the gospel.” Ephesians 3:6. He rewarded the faith of the centurion at Capernaum; He preached to the inhabitants of Sychar; and on His visit to Phoenicia, He healed the daughter of the Canaanite woman. Among those whom many regarded as unworthy of salvation, there were souls hungering for truth."},{"refcode_short":"TT 13.3","refcode_long":"From Trials to Triumph, p. 13.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Thus Christ sought to teach the disciples that in God's kingdom there are no territorial lines, no caste, no aristocracy.

But not until later did they realize in its fullness that God “made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth.” Acts 17:26."},{"refcode_short":"TT 13.4","refcode_long":"From Trials to Triumph, p. 13.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"These first disciples represented widely varied types of character. Differing in natural characteristics, they needed to come into unity. To this end Christ sought to bring them into unity with Himself. His burden for them was expressed in His prayer to His Father, “That they all may be one; ... that the world may know that Thou hast sent Me, and hast loved them, as Thou hast loved Me.” John 17:21-23.

He knew that they would suffer persecution, be cast out of the synagogues, and be thrown into prison. Some would suffer death. In speaking of their future, He was plain and definite, that in their coming trial they might remember His words and be strengthened to believe in Him as the Redeemer."},{"refcode_short":"TT 14.1","refcode_long":"From Trials to Triumph, p. 14.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"“Let not your heart be troubled,” He said. “I go to prepare a place for you.

Under the influence of the Spirit thousands were converted."},{"refcode_short":"TT 14.4","refcode_long":"From Trials to Triumph, p. 14.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"As Christ's representatives the apostles were to make a decided impression on the world.

They would declare that He whom the Jews had crucified was the Prince of life and that in His name they did the works that He had done."},{"refcode_short":"TT 14.5","refcode_long":"From Trials to Triumph, p. 14.5 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"On the night before the crucifixion the Saviour made no reference to the suffering He had endured and must yet endure. He sought to strengthen their faith, leading them to look forward to the joys that await the overcomer. He would do more for His followers than He had promised; from Him would flow love and compassion, making men like Him in character. His truth, armed with the power of the Spirit, would go forth conquering and to conquer."},{"refcode_short":"TT 15.1","refcode_long":"From Trials to Triumph, p. 15.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Christ did not fail, neither was He discouraged; and the disciples were to show a faith of the same nature.

The disciples were to work earnestly for souls. They were to go to the people with their message.

They would have to fight “against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.” Ephesians 6:12. But they would not be left to fight alone. He would be with them. If they would go forth in faith, One mightier than angels would be in their ranks—the General of the armies of heaven.
