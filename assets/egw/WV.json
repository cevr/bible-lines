White home; Elmshaven, the home of Ellen White; and several others. Arthur attended the nearby 10-grade church school and then continued his education at Pacific Union College. He received a certificate in business administration in 1928 and that same year was united in marriage with a classmate, Frieda Belle Swingle.

In 1978 he resigned as secretary of the Ellen G. White Estate to devote his energies almost exclusively to the biography project.

Those who have a true knowledge of God will not become so infatuated with the laws of matter and the operations of nature as to overlook or to refuse to acknowledge the continual working of God in nature. Deity is the author of nature. The natural world has in itself no inherent power but that which God supplies. How strange, then, that so many make a deity of nature! God furnishes the matter and the properties with which to carry out His plans; Nature is but His agency (Ibid.)."},{"refcode_short":"WV 352.6","refcode_long":"Ellen White: Woman of Vision, p. 352.6 (Arthur Lacey White)","content":"But at this time Kellogg was not prone to receive messages of caution and reproof.

Four years later land was bought on Best Street in North Fitzroy and a building erected to house the emerging Echo Publishing Company and to provide a meeting hall on the second floor. Commercial work was taken in to supply work to justify the sophisticated equipment needed to produce denominational publications. After printing in a commendable manner a pamphlet for the governor of Victoria, the Echo Publishing Company was officially appointed “Publishers to His Excellency Lord Brassey, KCB.” This gave the house standing and enhanced business. From one person employed in 1885 the work grew until in 1899 there were 83 employees.

The cow barn had space for 22 cows; to the one cow now occupying it, it must have seemed a bit lonely. A few chickens completed the farm population.

Then, as agreed, the sanitarium bought back 8.7 acres (3.5 hectares) for a sewage-disposal area at the far west corner of the property, and 5.5 acres (2.2 hectares) for a food factory across Blackmon Canyon Creek to the east and south. For these two pieces of land and for the half interest in the spring, $3,000 was subtracted from the $8,000. Ellen White paid Burden $1,000 in cash and assumed a $4,000 mortgage with interest at 6 ¼ percent. “It is like stepping out of our home in Cooranbong,” she wrote to her old friends the Farnsworths, “into one already prepared for us, without any time or care on our part” (Letter 146, 1900)."},{"refcode_short":"WV 374.2","refcode_long":"Ellen White: Woman of Vision, p. 374.2 (Arthur Lacey White)","content":"On the day of the purchase they moved in, rather jubilantly, and she reported to Elder Irwin, “We are now located in our pleasant and much-appreciated home” (Letter 127, 1900).

There was grave danger of an imbalance that would divert attention from major objectives in the medical work of the church and, because of the heavy financial demands, curtail various lines of denominational work around the world.

Nonetheless, while she dreaded returning to Battle Creek in winter, or anytime, because of the burdens that would fall upon her when she returned to that city after an absence of 10 years, deep down in her heart she knew that the time would come when she would have to spend some time in Battle Creek.

Three of the translations were represented in The Great Controversy, but it was discovered that only one had the wholehearted approval of the author. The question now was, “Should all the matter quoted from this author be from just the one that had the author's approval?” To do so would call for a good many changes in The Great Controversy text, and in some cases, provide a less desirable wording.

Many were jealous for Ellen White and the Spirit of Prophecy, and, not having thought the matter through, held, for all practical purposes, to a theory of verbal inspiration in the work of God's prophets.

For this purpose every carriage in the city was used, and there were a number of automobiles. And then besides this, there were nine streetcars. No fares were collected on these cars, as they were provided by the church (DF 758)."},{"refcode_short":"WV 549.4","refcode_long":"Ellen White: Woman of Vision, p. 549.4 (Arthur Lacey White)","content":"The service at the cemetery was brief and impressive. A double quartet sang, I. H. Evans read appropriate scriptures, G. B. Thompson offered prayer, and then “the remains of our dear sister were tenderly and silently lowered into the grave to rest beside the body of her husband, Elder James White, who was buried in the same plot in 1881” (DF 756, In Memoriam, p. 24)."},{"refcode_short":"WV 549","refcode_long":"Ellen White: Woman of Vision, p. 549 (Arthur Lacey White)","content":"The Public Press"},{"refcode_short":"WV 549.5","refcode_long":"Ellen White: Woman of Vision, p. 549.5 (Arthur Lacey White)","content":"Newspaper notices and articles of various lengths appeared throughout the United States, from the Bay Area, where San Francisco and Oakland papers gave good space, to New York, where a respectable item was published in the New York Times.

The San Francisco Chronicle and the Oakland Tribune each gave 15 column inches (38 centimeters), selecting materials from the sheets furnished from Elmshaven. The Mountain View Register-Leader was perhaps the most generous, with 147 column inches (373 centimeters) devoted to the story, together with a two-column picture of Ellen White. The Detroit News-Tribune gave seven inches (18 centimeters)."},{"refcode_short":"WV 550.1","refcode_long":"Ellen White: Woman of Vision, p. 550.1 (Arthur Lacey White)","content":"The Battle Creek papers gave full coverage to the story."},{"refcode_short":"WV 550.2","refcode_long":"Ellen White: Woman of Vision, p. 550.2 (Arthur Lacey White)","content":"The St. Helena Star, July 23, 1915, reported:"},{"refcode_short":"WV 550.3","refcode_long":"Ellen White: Woman of Vision, p. 550.3 (Arthur Lacey White)","content":"Leader of Adventists dead.

Going upstairs to the big east room, where for fifteen years Mother had studied and prayed and planned and written, I found it vacant. The old couch and the tables and chairs and chests of drawers were in their usual places, and the big armchair with its swing board in front was where it used to be, between the big bay window and the fireplace; but the dear mother, whose presence had made this room the most precious place in all the world to me, was not there. Then I recalled the many times I had returned from the Eastern states, and had hastened up to Mother's room, sure of a hearty welcome, and an eager listener to my reports of meetings attended and of the progress of the work in which she was so deeply interested. But now there was no one in the writing chair to listen to my report (WCW to “Dear Friend,” October 20, 1915)."},{"refcode_short":"WV 551.1","refcode_long":"Ellen White: Woman of Vision, p. 551.1 (Arthur Lacey White)","content":"It was the end of an era in the life of the church.
