From time to time, light has been given me with reference to the duty of many of our people to leave this place, and go where they can spread the knowledge of the truth. Testimony on this point was given years ago, and why the people have been so backward in heeding it has been a mystery to me.

Our works are not in accordance with our faith. Our faith testifies that we are living under the proclamation of the most solemn and important message that was ever given to mortals. Yet in full view of this fact, our efforts, our zeal, our spirit of self-sacrifice, do not compare with the character of the work.

[Many think they are getting the next door to heaven, if they get into Battle Creek. Thus they have expressed it to me again and again.] Families have been coming from all directions to reside here, and many more have their faces set that way. [We can well testify of that, by the inflowing since the last Testimony was given.] Some who have come to Battle Creek, held offices in the little churches from which they moved, and their help and strength were needed there. When such arrive at Battle Creek, and meet with the numerous Sabbath-keepers there, they frequently feel that their testimonies are not needed, and their talent is therefore buried."},{"refcode_short":"GCDB March 20,  1891, par. 6","refcode_long":"General Conference Daily Bulletin March 20,  1891, paragraph 6","content":"Some choose Battle Creek because of the religious privileges it affords, yet wonder that their spirituality decreases after their sojourn there a few months. Is there not a cause? The object of many has been to advantage themselves pecuniarily,—to engage in business that will yield them greater profits. Their expectations in this particular may be realized, while they have dearth of soul, and become dwarfed in spiritual things. They take no special burden upon themselves, because they think they would be out of place. They do not know where to take hold to labor in so large a church, and therefore become idlers in their Master's vineyard. [Now Mark!] All who pursue this course only increase the labor of those who have the burden of the work in the church. They are as so many dead weights.

Instead of feeling the necessity of double energy, watchfulness, prayer, and diligent performance of duty, they do scarcely anything at all.

Missionaries are wanted to go into towns and villages and raise the standard of truth, that God may have his witnesses scattered all over the land that the light of truth may penetrate where it has not yet reached, and the standard of truth be raised where it is not yet known. The brethren should not flock together because it is more agreeable to them, but should seek to fulfill their high calling to do others good, to be instrumental in the salvation of at least one soul.

Some are selfish in this respect. In view of what Christ has done for us, and what he suffered for sinners, we should, out of pure, disinterested love for souls, imitate his example by sacrificing our own pleasure and convenience for their good. The joy set before Christ, which sustained him in all his sufferings was the salvation of poor sinners. This should be our joy, and the spur of our ambition in the cause of our Master. In so doing we please God, and manifest our love and devotion to him as his servants. He first loved us, and withheld not from us his beloved Son but gave him from his bosom to die that we might have life. Love, true love for our fellow-men, evinces love to God. We may make a high profession, yet without this love it is nothing. Our faith may lead us even to give our bodies to be burned, yet without self-sacrificing love, such as lived in the bosom of Jesus, and was exemplified in his life, we are as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal."},{"refcode_short":"GCDB March 20,  1891, par. 10","refcode_long":"General Conference Daily Bulletin March 20,  1891, paragraph 10","content":"It is not merely the ministers who are missionaries; every soul who has given himself to God is a missionary.

Where do you meet with opposition? In meeting opposition you are driven to the Lord of heaven for strength and support; you are driven to the gate of heaven, that the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness may shine into your hearts.

Then how important that all who come here should decide not to be a dead weight, a burden, but to catch every ray of light from the throne of God, and to educate, educate, EDUCATE themselves, that they may educate others.

God has given every man his work, and you are not to look to others; you are to look to your Master,—to him who has called you to his service.

If he should speak to them, methinks he would say, as he did to his prophet of old, “What doest thou here, Elijah?” In these words the Lord virtually said to Elijah, “I sent you to Ahab with a message, and how is it that you have strayed away here? Was it because Jezebel threatened to take off your head for bearing the living testimony which resulted in the death of the priests of Baal? What sent you here?” Elijah heard the threats of Jezebel, but he did not wait to hear what God had to say. He fled for his life, and hid in a cave. But God did not leave him there.

May the Lord awaken an interest in the hearts of those who are guiding this work, that light may shine in the darkened places. Those who are content to sit under the clear light of truth from Sabbath to Sabbath, and do nothing to diffuse the light, will after a time lose it themselves.

I want to know how the people who gather here from Sabbath to Sabbath are going to stand when the judgment shall sit, and the books shall be opened, and every one shall be judged according to the deeds done in the body? I want to know how we shall meet those souls unsaved whom we might have helped and blessed.

At first the people of these places may despise the truth, for they have heard much that is false and objectionable in regard to Sabbath-keepers. Now is it not the duty of some who are standing idle here, to go where they can represent Christ and his precious truth. Jesus might have stayed in the courts of heaven till today. He might never have come to our world, but he chose to do it. And why? Because he loved us.

They said, not that they were aware of. I answered, “Then there is one thing that I would be aware of. I would see that the light of truth was shining in these places.” Let a family move into each place,—a family whose members love Jesus, and who will walk with the cross of Calvary in view, who will lie low at the feet of Christ, because the more humble they are, the clearer will be their views of Christ and his matchless loveliness, and the great sacrifice that he has made to save perishing souls."},{"refcode_short":"GCDB March 20,  1891, par. 24","refcode_long":"General Conference Daily Bulletin March 20,  1891, paragraph 24","content":"Jesus left the courts of heaven, he laid off his royal robes and his royal crown, to undertake the salvation of the world, to bring many sons and daughters to God. He clothed his divinity with humanity. That was a humiliation; but he came still lower. He was poor; he worked at the carpenter's trade with his father, and in this act gave honor to all labor and to all honest poverty.

There are a few connected with the Office today who were with us then. For years we received no wages, except barely enough to furnish us with the plainest food and clothing. We were glad to wear second-hand clothes, and sometimes we had hardly food enough to sustain our strength. Everything else was put into the work.

To all who have stood in the way of the Testimonies, I would say, God has given a message to his people, and his voice will be heard, whether you hear or forbear.

There is distrust, selfishness, and suspicion. A few hold fast their profession of faith. Others have been leaving the simplicity of the faith, and as the result they are now treading on the border-land of skepticism. They are spiritually beclouded; and thus many are holding serious errors. Some sit in judgment on the Scriptures, declaring that this or that passage is not inspired, because it does not strike their minds favorably. They cannot harmonize it with their ideas of philosophy and science, “falsely so called.” Others for different reasons question portions of the word of God. Thus many walk blindly where the enemy prepares the way. Now, it is not the province of any man to pronounce sentence upon the Scriptures, to judge or condemn any portion of God's word. When one presumes to do this, Satan will create an atmosphere for him to breathe which will dwarf spiritual growth. When a man feels so very wise that he dares to dissect God's word, his wisdom is, with God, counted foolishness. When he knows more, he will feel that he has everything to learn.

It is then that they will stand firm at the post of duty, without parade, and without swerving because of reproach. The unbelieving spies stood ready to destroy Caleb. He saw the stones in the hands of those who had brought a false report, but this did not deter him; he had a message, and he would bear it. The same spirit will be manifested today by those who are true to God. The psalmist says, “They have made void thy law. Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.” When men press close to the side of Jesus, when Christ is abiding in their hearts by faith, their love for the commandments of God grows stronger in proportion to the contempt which the world heaps upon his holy precepts. It is at this time that the true Sabbath must be brought before the people by both pen and voice.

The Lord would make it manifest whether men by their own finite wisdom could acquire a knowledge of the truth, whether they could know God, their Creator. When Christ came to our world, the experiment had been fully made, and it proved the boasted wisdom of men to be but foolishness. Finite wisdom was utterly unable to come to right conclusions in regard to God, and therefore man was wholly incompetent to judge in regard to his law.

Every century of profligacy has treasured up wrath against the day of wrath; and when the time comes, and the iniquity is full, then God will do his strange work.

Let us get up and pray.” Long before this, we used to pray about establishing the printing-office. Then it was the Sanitarium. Prayer was interwoven with our very life experience. Day by day our petitions ascended to heaven, and God heard us. Now let us continue to pray. If we needed to pray about the establishment of these institutions, how much more do we need to pray for God to keep them as guardians of the truth. They are not to lift up any false standard. They are not to be false signposts for the people. Wherever you are, pray that God will keep these institutions. If your united prayers ascend to heaven in their behalf, God will hear; and if the men who are there prove unfaithful, he will remove them, and will put others there who will be true to him.

But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest.... And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them, Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and I whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.” Now let us be like children before God.

You are a small company, poor and illiterate, there are few talented men among you.” Can we expect that this will bring no temptation to those who see the reasons of our faith and feel the conviction of the Spirit of God in regard to the Bible truth presented?

If wisdom and sanctified judgment and skillful generalship are manifested by us as a people, in building up the interests of our Redeemer's kingdom in the world, humble sanctuaries will be erected, where those who lift the cross in obeying the truth may find a home, a place in which they can worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience."},{"refcode_short":"GCDB January 28,  1893, par. 13","refcode_long":"General Conference Daily Bulletin January 28,  1893, paragraph 13","content":"Those who are accounted by the world as illiterate, may by connecting themselves with the God of wisdom, have the divine enlightenment to work on mind and heart. “The entrance of thy words giveth light: it giveth understanding to the simple.” Who are those that are here called the simple?

It is then, and then only, that the human agents learn how wayward is the heart, and how unwilling to give up all for Jesus. But if they walk in the light while they have the light, they soon receive another kind of knowledge; they learn how mighty is the grace of God to subdue selfishness, and expel it from the soul.

It is the collision of error against truth. The tyrant is seeking to oppress man's conscience, that Christ has made free. Persecution will come more definitely and decidedly upon the people of God, because the godly are seeking for uprightness and holiness, and the disobedient are in sin.

When we secure the interest of the people in this great central truth, faith and hope and courage come to the heart. If God has given his Son to die for sinners, he means to counteract sin.

The Lord did not leave his holy tabernacle to be borne indiscriminately by any tribe that might choose.

When it was for the good of the people and the glory of God, that they should pitch their tents in a certain place, God signified his will to them by causing the pillar of cloud to rest directly over the tabernacle, where it remained until he would have them journey again. In all their journeyings they were required to observe perfect order. Every tribe bore a banner with the sign of their father's house upon it, and each tribe was required to pitch under its own standard. When the ark moved, the armies journeyed, the different tribes marching in order, under their own standards. The Levites were designated by the Lord as the tribe in the midst of whom the sacred ark was to be borne, Moses and Aaron marching just in front of the ark, and the sons of Aaron following near them, each bearing trumpets.

And there are thousands who might enter the harvest field who are now religiously idle, and as a result, go crippling their way to heaven, expressing their doubt whether they are Christians. Their need is a vital union with Jesus Christ. Then it can be said of them, ‘Ye are laborers together with God.’ I want to say to many, You are waiting for some one to carry you to the vineyard and set you to work or to bring the vineyard to you, that you will experience no inconvenience in labor. You will wait in vain. If you will lift up your eyes you will see the harvest ripe, ready for the sickle, whichever way you may look; you will find work close by and far off. But of how many will Christ say in the judgment, ‘Good and faithful servants’? I think how the angels must feel seeing the end approaching, and those who claim to have a knowledge of God and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent, huddle together, colonize, and attend the meetings, and feel dissatisfied if there is not much preaching to benefit their souls and strengthen the church, while they are doing literally nothing. If they are branches, really and truly, of the True Vine, nourished by the sap which flows from the vine to the branches, they are indeed partakers of the divine nature. They have moral power from Christ to overcome Satan, to hate sin; and these cannot be silent. Souls are perishing for the light and knowledge of the truth which these have. It is their duty to put that knowledge to use to save souls.

You will constantly be drawing near to Christ; exercising your minds to hear, devising means to save perishing souls.

They are to consider themselves a peculiar people of God, an object to be rendered conspicuous, detached from other objects, standing apart. Believers are to be one, as Christ is one with the Father. The sons and daughters of God are to stand a distinct, pure, holy people from the world. And if these signs are not seen in the members of the church, it is the duty of the church faithfully to investigate the matter, for if there is not a decided transformation of character from a life of sin to a life of holiness, then why?

Whatever influence for good as followers of Christ, as believers in the truth, they may have to improve, refine, and elevate the world in their association with it, and personal effort put forth, will depend upon their vital connection with the breadth and distinctness of the line of demarkation which characterizes them as separate from the world, and the perfection of contrast to the world which they reveal in spirit, in words, in works, from the world. The world loves not God, the world is disobedient to God, the world is selfish and acts without feelings of dependence on God's will, without reverence and respect to God's commandments. If the professed followers of Christ, even in part, act the same as the world, they may have their names on the church books, but when joined to the church they are not joined to Christ.

There is with many a marked distinction between natural and supernatural. The natural is ascribed to ordinary causes, unconnected with the interference with God. Vital power is attributed to matter, and nature is made a deity. Matter is supposed to be placed in certain relations, and left to act from fixed laws, with which God himself cannot interfere; that nature is endowed with certain properties and placed subject to laws, and left to itself to obey these laws, and perform the work originally commanded.

It is by his power that vegetation is caused to flourish, that every leaf appears and every flower blooms. It is not as the result of a mechanism, that, once set in motion, continues its work, that the pulse beats and breath follows breath. In God we live and move and have our being.

Divine inspiration asks many questions which the most profound scholar cannot answer. These questions were not asked, supposing that we could answer them, but to call our attention to the deep mysteries of God, and to make men know that their wisdom is limited, that in the common things of daily life there are mysteries past the comprehension of finite minds; that the judgment and purposes of God are past finding out, is wisdom unsearchable. If he reveals himself to man, it is by shrouding himself in the thick cloud of mystery. God's purpose is to conceal more of himself than he makes known to man. Could men fully understand the ways and works of God, they would not then believe him to be the infinite One. He is not to be comprehended by man in his wisdom, and reasons, and purposes. “His ways are past finding out.” His love can never be explained upon natural principles. If this could be done, we would not feel that we could trust him with the interests of our souls. Skeptics refuse to believe, because with their finite minds they cannot comprehend the infinite power by which God reveals himself to men. Even the mechanism of the human body cannot be fully understood; it presents mysteries that baffle the most intelligent. Yet because human science cannot in its research explain the ways and works of the Creator, men will doubt the existence of God, and ascribe infinite power to nature. God's existence, his character, his law, are facts that all the reasoning of men of the highest attainments cannot controvert. They deny the claims of God, and neglect the interest of their souls, because they cannot understand his ways and works. Yet God is ever seeking to instruct finite men that they may exercise faith in him and trust themselves wholly in his hands. Every drop of rain or flake of snow, every spire of grass, every leaf and flower and shrub, testifies of God.

I saw workmen building humble houses of worship. Those newly come to the faith were helping with willing hands, and those who had means were assisting with their means. In the basement of the church, above ground, a school room was prepared for the children. Teachers were selected to go to this place. The numbers in the school were not large, but it was a happy beginning.

They could not do this if they did not by faith grasp the promises of God for the forgiveness of their sins.

Elated with his ideas of progression, man is setting his feet in the path that leads to degradation and death. Satan, in a deceptive garb, still lurks in the tree of knowledge. The words of God spoken at creation. “But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it,” come sounding along the line of ages to us today, for “they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.” “Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in sincerity and in truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt: and serve ye the Lord. And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve.” “If the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him.”"},{"refcode_short":"GCDB March 6,  1899, par. 36","refcode_long":"General Conference Daily Bulletin March 6,  1899, paragraph 36","content":"The garden of Eden was not only Adam's dwelling, but his school-room.

After sin entered this world, the heavenly Husbandman transplanted the tree of life to the paradise above; but its branches hang over the wall to the lower world. Through the redemption purchased by the blood of the Son of God, man may now partake of its life-giving fruit. The tree of knowledge has its roots in the earth—it is of the earth, earthy.

It was attractive to them; and in their great desire for it, they partook of it, and lost their purity and their allegiance to God.

It will be as the knowledge gained by eating of the fruit of the forbidden tree. All the speculative opinions which, through the devising of Satan, have been brought into educational work, are to be separated from the truth. This was the work of the Redeemer in coming into the world. The opinions and speculations of men had become abundant; they occupied the ground with a multitude of theories which made it difficult to distinguish truth from error. In view of the near coming of him who is the Truth, now of all other times, we are to know the truth, and the truth is to make us free.

If God's word is eaten as the bread of life, they will become thoroughly aroused to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling, knowing that it is God that worketh in them, both to will and to do his own good pleasure. Men must co-operate with God. By obedience to his laws, they must reveal the respect they have for his word.

Human ambition has been seeking for that kind of knowledge that will bring self-exaltation and glory and supremacy. Thus Adam and Eve were worked upon by Satan, until God's restraint was snapped asunder, and their education under the teacher of lies began in order that they might have the knowledge that God had refused them,—to know the consequences of transgression.

The wild branch has been grafted in, and has borne wild grapes. The result has been centuries of darkness and error. Men have introduced human theories, thinking as did our first parents when tempted by Satan to eat of the tree of knowledge, that they would thus become as gods.
