It is a grand, a noble work, and one which should call forth every energy of the being. As laborers for God, we need a more sacred nearness to him, and a closer fellowship with one another, that our prayers and efforts may not be hindered. We must not expect in our own strength to meet and press through the moral darkness that is in the world but we must perseveringly labor for that strength which is found alone in Jesus. He loves us, and those who labor in his spirit will realize his assistance in all their efforts. It is impossible, even with the strong arguments of truth, to reach the hearts of men, unless there is, united with these arguments, a divine power."},{"refcode_short":"HS 119.2","refcode_long":"Historical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists, p. 119.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"A machine may be perfect in all its parts, and yet there be much friction and wear in its movements; but apply oil, and it performs its work quietly and well. So with us. It is necessary to have the oil of grace in our hearts, in order to prevent the friction that may arise between us and those for whom we labor. Then, having not only the arguments of truth but the oil of grace, we can bear the message with power. Prejudice will be broken down, and a great work will be accomplished. “Without me.” says Christ, “ye can do nothing.” The branch cannot bear fruit except it abide in the vine; neither can we except we abide in Christ."},{"refcode_short":"HS 119.3","refcode_long":"Historical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists, p. 119.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"If the love of Jesus is cherished in the heart, it will be seen in the labors; the will and the manners will be brought under the moulding influence of the Holy Spirit. In the prayer of Christ just before his crucifixion, he said, “And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.” The teacher of the people must be an example to the flock of God in all meekness, patience, forbearance, and love. He is, in a special sense, a living epistle, “known and read of all men.” How important, then, that the sanctifying power of the truth be seen in his character."},{"refcode_short":"HS 119.4","refcode_long":"Historical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists, p. 119.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The minister of God must first drink of the living fountain himself if he would firmly and intelligently lead others to that fountain. If he would present those for whom he labors, perfect in Christ, he must himself be perfect. Divine power alone will reach and melt the sinner's heart, and bring him, a penitent, to Christ. Neither Luther, Melancthon, Wesley, Whitefield, nor any other great reformer and teacher, could of himself have gained such access to hearts as to accomplish the work that these men accomplished.

Such a course would charm into believing many who have intrenched themselves behind the breast-works of infidelity. The influence of a true Christian character is like a cheering ray of sunlight that pierces to the remotest corner the darkness into which it is allowed to enter. The light emanating from the example of the Christian minister should not be fitful and uncertain, like the flash of a meteor, but it should have the calm, steady radiance of the heavenly stars."},{"refcode_short":"HS 120.2","refcode_long":"Historical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists, p. 120.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The true minister of Christ should be encircled by an atmosphere of spiritual light, because he is connected with the world of light, and walks with Christ, who is the light of the world. Arguments may be resisted, persuasion and entreaty may be scorned, the most eloquent appeals, supported by the rigor of logic, may be disregarded; but a living character of righteousness, a daily piety in the walks of life, an anxiety for the sinner wherever found, the spirit of truth burning in the heart, beaming from the countenance, and breathing from the lips in every word, constitute a sermon which is hard to resist or to set aside, and which makes the strongholds of Satan tremble.

He has given them a special work, that of standing in defense of truth. They are his workmen; all should respect them, and they should respect one another. In the army, officers are required to respect their fellow-officers, and the privates soon learn the lesson.

If he had seen that angels, who are perfect, would have done the work for the fallen race better than men, he would have committed it to them.

In meekness and love teach them to bear responsibilities, and to labor for others. Jesus loves them just as much as he does you, and is just as willing to help them if they will learn to trust in him. If you see imperfections in them, do not discourage them and drive them from the truth by manifesting an overbearing, critical spirit. This is not the spirit of Christ. What does God say? “Come now, and let us reason together.” He does not say, You are defective, and I will have nothing to do with you. “Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.

When he went to labor for the Jews, he did not first make prominent the birth, betrayal, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ, notwithstanding these were the special truths for that time. He first brought them down step by step over the promises that had been made of a Saviour, and over the prophecies that pointed him out. After dwelling upon these until the specifications were distinct in the minds of all, and they knew that they were to have a Saviour, he then presented the fact that this Saviour had already come. Christ Jesus fulfilled every specification. This was the “guile” with which Paul caught souls.

When you are laboring in a place where souls are just beginning to get the scales from their eyes, and to see men as trees walking, be very careful not to present the truth in such a way as to arouse prejudice, and to close the door of the heart to the truth. Agree with the people on every point where you can consistently do so. Let them see that you love their souls, and want to be in harmony with them so far as possible. If the love of Christ is revealed in all your efforts, you will be able to sow the seed of truth in some hearts; God will water the seed sown, and the truth will spring up and bear fruit to his glory."},{"refcode_short":"HS 122.2","refcode_long":"Historical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists, p. 122.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Oh that I could impress upon all the necessity of laboring in the spirit of Jesus; for I have been shown that souls here in Europe have been turned away from the truth because of a lack of tact and skill in presenting it. In kindness and love seek to instruct those who oppose you. Preach the truth with the meekness of simplicity, remembering that it is not your words but the word of God which is to cut its way to the heart. There is danger, even in laboring among our churches, of leaving the great principles of truth and dwelling too much upon small, unimportant matters that create a fault-finding spirit among brethren. There are always those in the church and out who have not the love of Jesus in their souls, and who have, in the place of true religion, a criticising, exacting spirit, a desire to find something to condemn in their brethren and sisters. Such ones grasp eagerly at this kind of labor; but they do more harm than good, and should not be encouraged."},{"refcode_short":"HS 122.3","refcode_long":"Historical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists, p. 122.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The third angel's message is infallible. Upon the grand, ennobling truths connected with that message you can dwell with perfect safety. Labor intelligently to encourage union of faith and union of judgment, that all may be united in the bonds of Christian fellowship and love; but do not belittle the work of God with ideas and notions of your own.

Let each one study the plain teachings of the Scriptures as to simplicity and plainness of dress and by faithful obedience to those teachings strive to set a worthy example to the world and to those new in the faith. God does not want any one person to be conscience for another. Talk of the love and humility of Jesus; but do not encourage the brethren and sisters to engage in picking flaws in the dress or appearance of one another. Some take delight in this work; and when their minds are turned in this direction, they begin to feel that they must become church tinkers. They climb upon the judgment seat, and as soon as they see one of their brethren or sisters, they look to find something to criticise. This is one of the most effectual means of becoming narrow-minded, and of dwarfing spiritual growth. God would have them step down from the judgment seat, for he has never placed them there. I speak thus plainly because I know your danger in this country. Already souls have become discouraged and given up the truth because of this spirit manifested toward them."},{"refcode_short":"HS 123.1","refcode_long":"Historical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists, p. 123.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"When the subject of dress is dwelt upon explicitly, there are some who feel all the burden over it that they ought to feel for a soul balancing between life and death. I once attended a meeting where this spirit existed. There was the most solemn interest that I ever saw. Seventy-five were baptized before the meeting closed. After speaking to the crowd in public, I labored for the youth privately, talking and praying with them as they came to my tent. Many were greatly blessed; but there was a company on the ground who had no burden. I could hear their idle conversation, their trifling laugh, while agonizing prayer was being offered for the unconverted. In the height of the interest, one of this number came to me and said that some were in trial because Sister White wore gold. Some time before, I had received a present of a little open-faced, gold watch. It was very ancient in appearance, and certainly never would have been worn for its beauty. I carried it because it was a good timekeeper. But in order to avoid all occasion for any to stumble, I sold the watch, and I would recommend that others follow a similar course. This is in harmony with the teaching of the apostle Paul, who says: “Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.”"},{"refcode_short":"HS 123.2","refcode_long":"Historical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists, p. 123.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"All the religion many have is to pick flaws. I once knew a lady whose religion was of just this character, and in her family she was so overbearing that they could hardly live with her. A tent-meeting was held near the place where she lived, but instead of taking hold to help those who were laboring very hard in the meetings, or to receive help herself, this woman stood back to criticise. On returning to the house one day, I found her searching my trunk to see if there was not some article of clothing in it that she could condemn. We shall ever have just such people to deal with in this world. But if we do not enter too much into particulars, they will have no excuse for indulging their natural disposition. It is a marvel to me what patience the Lord has with such crooked material.

But strike the ax at the root of the tree, and not only will the leaves fall off of themselves, but the tree will die. Those who accept the truth, in the love of it, will die to the world, and will become meek and lowly in heart like their divine Lord.

We may get up points that are of no consequence, and seek to maintain them; but we shall gain no strength by so doing. The message is to prepare a people to stand in the last great day, and to be united in heaven above.

This is because Satan is perfectly satisfied with our condition when we are clothed with self-righteousness and do not realize our need of divine aid; but when we see our great need of help, and begin to draw near to God, he knows that God will draw near to us; therefore he places every possible obstruction in the way so that we shall not come into close connection with the Source of our strength."},{"refcode_short":"HS 134.5","refcode_long":"Historical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists, p. 134.5 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The exhortation of the apostle is, “Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.” It is by engaging in this work, and by exercising living faith in God, that we are to perfect Christian character.

He wants to make you all light in him; he wants to fill your hearts with love, and peace, and hope. If, then, you continue to cling to your darkness, you dishonor him; for you do not correctly represent to the world a sin-pardoning Saviour. If you are gloomy, desponding, hopeless, you are a poor representative of the Christian religion. Christ died for all. The sacrifice was complete. It is your privilege and duty to show to the world that you have an entire, all-powerful Saviour. It was the Son of the infinite God who died to purchase a full and free salvation for all that would accept it. Then why not take him as your Saviour?

A person receives a tract or paper. He reads a little in it, finds something that does not agree with his former views, and throws it aside. But the few words he did read are not forgotten. Unwelcome though they are, they remain in the mind until an interest is awakened to read further on the subject. Again the paper is taken up; again the reader finds something in it that is opposed to his long-cherished opinions and customs, and he angrily flings it aside. But the rejected messenger says nothing to increase his opposition or arouse his combativeness; and when the force of his anger dies away, and the paper is again brought out, it tells the same simple, straightforward story, and he finds in it precious gems. Angels of God are near to impress the unspoken word upon his heart; and, although loath to do so, he at last yields, and light takes possession of his soul.

Then in the day of fierce trial he will say, “Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee; hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.” What are the chambers in which they are to hide?

We must not limit the power of the Holy One of Israel. He wants us to come to him just as we are, sinful and polluted. His blood is efficacious. I entreat you not to grieve his Spirit by continuing in sin. If you fall under temptation, do not become discouraged. This promise comes ringing down along the line to our time: “If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.” I feel that for this one promise a continual song of thanksgiving ought to go forth from the lips of mortals.

It is not impossible that deer might often be replaced by equally beautiful herds of cattle; that landscape gardening and ornamental building behind immense stone walls might be carried on with less contempt for expense; that there would be less money to spare for yachting, and for building dog palaces and hiring men to care for them.

The porter was [told] to get up early and have the door unlocked at half past six; but this he failed to do until wakened by us in the morning.

As you approach the train, a gentlemanly official opens the door of a first, second, or third class compartment, according to your ticket, and if you object to one in which smoking is permitted, he finds one in which it is prohibited. Entering through the narrow door, you find yourself in a little room about seven feet by nine, with two seats and two doors, a seat on each side and a door at each end. The end of the compartment is the side of the car. On each side of the doors are stationary windows, and in the upper part of the door is a window which can be lowered or raised according to the amount of ventilation desired. Just before the train leaves the station, the doors are all closed and locked, and are at once unlocked on reaching another station.

Kellogg and William thought best to secure a berth for me in the sleeping car; but we were traveling with second-class tickets, and the only sleeping car on this train was a first-class coach. To exchange my ticket for first-class, and pay the additional expense for a berth in the sleeper, would cost eleven dollars. This, of course, we could not afford to pay. Fortunately, however, we secured to ourselves a compartment in a car that went through to Basle without change, and by a skillful arrangement of our satchels, bundles, and blankets converted our compartment into a sleeping car, and secured a degree of rest. The railroad builders of Europe have not planned, as have those in America, to prevent the comfort of travelers; and if you can secure plenty of room, you can make yourself quite comfortable for the night in these coaches that at first seem so strange and inconvenient.

Under the influence of a long peace its towns had enlarged in size, its villages had increased in number, and its smiling fields testified to the excellence of its husbandry. The early dew of the Reformation was not yet exhaled. The sweet breath of that morning gave it a healthy moral vigor, quickened its art and industry, and filled the land with all good things. Wealth abounded in the cities, and even the country people lived in circumstances of comfort and ease.” Since the Reformation, a school had existed in every town and village in which there was a church, and a knowledge of reading and writing was generally diffused among the people. The Bible had found its way into their houses. The hymns of Luther were sung in their churches and their homes."},{"refcode_short":"HS 176.4","refcode_long":"Historical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists, p. 176.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"But during the terrible years that followed, all this was changed. Foreign soldiery, savage and blood-besmeared, traversed the country, marking their course by pillage, fire, and murder. The greatest imaginable horrors were so common that it was a matter of surprise when they failed to be perpetrated. At the approach of the troops, the terror-stricken people sought safety in flight. “They dived into the darkest parts of the forest; they burrowed in the bleakest moors; they lurked in old clay pits and in masses of fallen masonry; and to this day the people of those parts show the retreats where their wretched forefathers sought refuge from the fury of the soldiery.” The war ended in victory to the Protestants; and the religious toleration which was then won, they have ever since enjoyed. But the long, awful strife had covered the period of a generation. When peace was at last declared, the whole land had become a tomb. Cities, towns, and villages were in flames. The country was empty of men; the high-roads were without travelers, and briers and thorns covered the once richly cultivated field.

Hansen, in the hope that by showing that the Bible presents as forcibly the duty of keeping the seventh day, which is universally disregarded, as it does the duty of baptism, he could lead him to renounce the idea of being immersed. He argued that the Sabbath is disregarded by Baptists as well as others, and it could be no worse to set aside immersion than to reject the Sabbath. But the result of this effort was the reverse of what the minister wished. Bro. Hansen read the tract again and again, wept and prayed over it, and instead of renouncing baptism, he decided to keep the Sabbath. At first he thought it his duty to keep Sunday also, and in the attempt to keep two days became discouraged, and gave up the Sabbath. But just at this time Bro. Brorsen came to his help, and explained from the Bible the true relation of the Sabbath and Sunday. Some time later, he was much impressed by reading in the Advent Tidende an account of what I had seen in regard to some in foreign countries receiving the papers and tracts, reading them, praying over them, and finally taking their stand on the Sabbath, for this exactly described his experience."},{"refcode_short":"HS 185","refcode_long":"Historical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists, p. 185 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"A Missionary Field"},{"refcode_short":"HS 185.1","refcode_long":"Historical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists, p. 185.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Copenhagen seems like Athens in Paul's day.

Those who had listened to the gospel of God's glorious grace desired to express their feelings in songs of praise, but there existed nothing in the Danish language suitable to be used on such occasions. In the Romish church the people were silent worshipers; the only songs were the chants and canticles of the priests in an unknown tongue. But such worship could not satisfy an intelligent faith. A translation of the songs of David into the Danish language, soon after published, was everywhere received with great joy. They soon displaced the ballads which had been sung till then.

Many are continually saying, “All that we have to do is to believe in Christ.” They claim that faith is all we need. In its fullest sense, this is true; but they do not take it in the fullest sense. To believe in Jesus is to take him as our redeemer and our pattern. If we abide in him and he abides in us, we are partakers of his divine nature, and are doers of his word. The love of Jesus in the heart will lead to obedience to all his commandments. But the love that goes no farther than the lips, is a delusion; it will not save any soul. Many reject the truths of the Bible, while they profess great love for Jesus; but the apostle John declares, “He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.” While Jesus has done all in the way of merit, we ourselves have something to do in the way of complying with the conditions. “If ye love me,” said our Saviour, “keep my commandments.”"},{"refcode_short":"HS 189","refcode_long":"Historical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists, p. 189 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Humble Laborers"},{"refcode_short":"HS 189.1","refcode_long":"Historical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists, p. 189.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"There are some in Stockholm who in humble circumstances are seeking earnestly to spread the knowledge of the truth.

His profits have been very small, especially on those of our Swedish books that are published in America, where the cost of production is greater than in Europe, and the expense of transportation to Norway and then to Sweden must be added to the first cost. When the whole expense is taken from the low prices at which books are sold in these countries, very little margin is left for the colporter. On one of the large bound books he received but five cents a copy, on some other books only three cents. [At the General Conference of 1885, the Trustees of the S. D. A. Publishing Association voted to furnish publications to foreign missions at the cost of production. This will help the colporteurs in many fields.] On those works published at our office in Christiania he received one-third discount; but these are mostly small pamphlets or tracts which sell for a few cents each. Of course it is difficult to support himself and his wife on such profits; but Bro. Norlin's wife is an industrious worker, doing house-cleaning, washing, or any other kind of hard work by which she can help in gaining a livelihood. They live in a very economical manner, occupying one good-sized room on a fourth floor, with the use of a small kitchen with another family. This is a sample of how the work has had to be done in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. Those who are thus traveling on foot and carrying the books and papers in their leathern sacks are apparently engaged in a humble work; but they should not feel that it is in any sense degrading. It was in a humble manner that Christ labored when he was on the earth; he went on foot from place to place, teaching as he walked.

The majority, even of those who bear Christ's name, are unwilling to follow his example of self-denial and cross-bearing; and as they become more and more alienated from him, they cannot distinguish between the heavenly and the earthly; their peace is disturbed by the fact that there is a people that serve God and renounce every sinful practice. Men who are trampling upon God's requirements feel a constant rebuke from the course of those who render obedience to him; and this is why such enmity is manifested against all who are true to God.

The people, intimidated by the threats of the priests and rulers, ceased their joyful proclamation as they entered the gates of Jerusalem; but the children in the temple courts afterward took up the refrain, and, waving their branches of palm, they cried, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” When the Pharisees, sorely displeased, said unto him, “Hearest thou what these say?” Jesus answered, “Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?” As God wrought through children in Christ's day, so he wrought through them in giving the first message.

While he was suffering the keenest pangs of hunger, weak and emaciated from fasting, Satan was at hand with his manifold temptations to assail the Son of God, to take advantage of his weakness and overcome him, and thus thwart the plan of salvation. But Christ was steadfast. He overcame in behalf of the race, that he might rescue them from the degradation of the fall. He showed that in his strength it is possible for us to overcome. Jesus sympathizes with the weakness of men; he came to earth that he might bring to us moral power.

In the Sabbath meetings, when all should be individually engaged in the worship of God, an accusing spirit is allowed to come in, and one bears testimony against another. This spirit is wholly unlike Christ, and leads to dissension and wrangling. God no more accepts such worship than he accepted Cain's offering. There is no more effectual hindrance to growth in grace than this disposition to criticize and condemn others.

I remember when we were looking for the Saviour to come in 1844, how great was the anxiety of each to know that his own heart was right before God. When we met together, the question would be asked by one and another, “Brethren, have you seen anything in me that is not right? I know that we are often blind to our own faults, and if you have seen anything wrong in me, I want you to tell me.” Sometimes errors would be pointed out, and we would all bow before God and seek forgiveness.

Sometimes brethren who had difficulty would be seen going away together to some secret place to plead with God, and they would return with their hearts knit together in love.

Here I was provided with a state-room containing two sofas, and shut in by heavy curtains,—accommodations which we then thought hardly necessary for a day journey of only six hours. We had occasion, however, to change this opinion before reaching land. The first hour we spent on deck, in the cheerful and well-furnished ladies’ cabin. The weather was pleasant, the sea smooth, and we anticipated an enjoyable trip. But soon the captain, passing through the cabin, advised us to go below and lie down at once, for we were coming into rough water. We complied, though rather unwillingly. In a short time the boat began to rock violently; we could hardly keep our position upon the sofas. I became very ill, now in a profuse perspiration, as if every organ was struggling against the terrible malady, and then overcome by deathly seasickness.

As I lay helpless and exhausted, with closed eyes and ashen face, Sister McEnterfer feared that I was dead. She was herself unable to leave her sofa, but from time to time she called my name to assure herself that I was still living. Death seemed very near, but I felt that I could cling, with the firm grasp of faith, to the hand of Jesus. He who holds the waters in the hollow of his hand could keep us in the tempest. The waves of the great deep obey his voice, “Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further; and here shall thy proud waves be stayed.” I thought how Jesus calmed the fears of his disciples as he stilled the stormy Galilee; and should I be afraid to trust to His protection who had given me my work? My heart was kept in perfect peace because it was stayed on him. The lesson of trust I learned during these few hours was very precious.

Had it not been important, God would not have wrought in so marvelous a manner to deliver his people from Egyptian bondage. It was because he saw that they could not obey his commandments in their servitude, that he revealed his mighty arm in bringing them into a place where they could serve him. When they came to Sinai, he took occasion to refresh their minds in regard to his requirements. Christ and the Father, standing side by side upon the mount, with solemn majesty proclaimed the ten commandments, placing in the very center of the decalogue the Sabbath command. Again and again the Lord told the people that if they would keep his Sabbath he would take them to himself to be his chosen people; and again and again sorrow and shame were brought upon them because they failed to keep it. He also told them that the Sabbath should be a sign between him and them forever, that they might know that he was the Lord their God.

As the conscientious Christian takes his stand upon Bible truth, there are always those who refuse to accept it, and choose the world. The wife may take her position in favor of truth, while the husband may oppose it. Here a trial comes in at once, the trial of separation in faith and feeling. Shall we say to that wife, “You should leave your husband because he does not keep the Sabbath?” No, indeed. If she was a faithful wife before she accepted the truth, and if she sees in her friends those for whom Christ has died, she will seek to discharge her duties with even greater fidelity after she accepts the truth, that if possible she may lead them to see the light. “But,” it is asked, “should not the believing wife yield her convictions of duty because of her husband's unbelief?” By no means; because Christ is her Lord and Master.

If they have light upon the Sabbath, they cannot be saved in rejecting that light. But none will be held accountable for light which they have never received.

The Vaudois might have cut the ropes, and dispatched their foes as they were being lowered one by one; but the boldness of the maneuver would seem to have paralyzed them. They retreated into the cavern to find in it their grave. Seeing the danger of permitting his men to follow them into the depths of their hiding-place, the general adopted the easier and safer method of piling up at its entrance all the wood he could collect and setting fire to it. A huge volume of black smoke began to roll into the cave, leaving to the unhappy inmates the miserable alternative of rushing out and falling by the sword that waited for them, or of remaining in the interior to be stifled by the murky vapor. Some rushed out, and were massacred; but the greater part remained until death slowly approached them by suffocation. When the cavern was afterward examined, there were found in it four hundred infants, suffocated in their cradles or in the arms of their dead mothers.

We can believe this from an incident that occurred a few months ago. A lady became very much interested in the truth, and began to keep the Sabbath. As soon as this was known, she was visited by leading ones in the church, and told that there was some means in the mission treasury, and that if she would not unite with us they would appropriate a certain amount toward repairing her house; and more than this, they would give her a certain amount each month.

The principal market-days in this place are Sunday and Friday forenoons. It was to us a novel way of keeping Sunday. Men and women were crying their wares, and people were hurrying to and fro, many of them anxious to return home with their purchases in time to prepare for church.

A swift-flowing mountain stream crosses the main street at right angles, and in an open space we see a row of women kneeling on its banks. On coming a little nearer, we find that they are washing. Each one is kneeling in a small box with the cover and one side removed, and a little straw laid on the bottom. In front of each is a slanting slab of granite rock which she uses something as we would a rubbing board. However, instead of rubbing the clothes, they squeeze, and slap, and rinse them, using a stiff brush and soap on the dirtiest parts. Occasionally one would have a few live coals by her side with a little pail of hot water in which to dip her hands when they became too stiff and cold. Most of them seemed to take considerable pains to get their clothes clean, and after they had finished they put them across a stick and carried them home on their shoulders. We are told that in all well-to-do families washing is seldom done oftener than once in six weeks, and sometimes only once in three months. It is then done by hand, without the aid even of a rubbing-board. This is the common way of washing. In the cities, places are prepared in various parts for this work; while in the country, women may be seen far off in the fields, away from any house, washing in some stream from which they have perhaps broken the ice. There are those, of course, who have regular wash-rooms in their house or in a separate building. These are furnished with immense tubs, around which the entire family can gather, if need be, when wash week comes. One room is used exclusively for clean clothes, and one for dirty, and before the soiled ones are put away, they are sprinkled with a powder which prevents them from smelling bad or spoiling."},{"refcode_short":"HS 245.1","refcode_long":"Historical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists, p. 245.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The question with us is how these women can keep their hands in ice-cold water for hours at a time without injury to their health.

Another thing which it seems reasonable to suppose would produce this unnatural swelling, is the heavy loads that many carry on their heads and backs. It is not uncommon to see a man or woman coming down the mountains, carrying a bundle of wood or hay much larger than himself.

Judging from the expression which we saw upon the countenances of many, the last ray of hope had died out of their souls, their ambition was gone, and as long as life should last they expected only hunger, toil, and misery. The children are taught to work almost from infancy. We met little ones not more than six years old walking and knitting as busily and intelligently as women of sixty. And many at the tender age of seven or eight are placed in factories, or set to work in stone quarries. This seemed at first almost cruel; but when we learned that the most experienced workmen in the factories received only fifty cents for sixteen hours’ work, and those less experienced only twenty-five cents, and that from this meager pittance some were obliged to support a family of from eight to twelve, we felt less like judging them harshly for allowing their children to work rather than to starve. As the result, however, of standing on their feet so many hours, and working so hard in childhood, many never attain their full growth.

This, however, refers to bread that is baked in rolls a little larger than a pipe stem, and about a yard long. This is a kind of bread peculiar to the Piedmont valleys. Repeated efforts have been put forth to make it in other places, but without success. It is as light and sweet as it is possible for bread to be, but is too expensive for the poorer classes.

Horses are seldom used here except before carriages; mules, Sardinian ponies, donkeys, and oxen are quite common; but the animals most commonly used for ordinary farm labor are cows. These are usually driven by ropes attached to their horns, the driver walking by their side or going in front and guiding them by pulling them this way or that.

This is purely an economical scheme, the heat from the animals being made to answer instead of fire. Fuel of all kinds is high. Coal can hardly be obtained.

Here day after day, at certain seasons of the year, we see the soldiers training. They are drilled in all the duties of the army, so that in case of war they may be ready at the call of the government to engage in actual service. One day a fine tent was brought upon the ground. Then came the discipline of pitching it and taking it down; instruction was given as to setting it up in proper order, every man having his specific work. Several times the tent was erected and taken down. By another company, many small cannon were brought upon the ground, and lessons were given by the officers in the matter of moving these quickly from place to place, in taking apart the cannon wagon, and setting the gun ready for use, and in quickly attaching again the fore wheels so as to be ready at the call to set them in motion in an instant. Ambulances were brought to the ground, and the sanitary corps were taught to take care of the wounded. Men were laid upon stretchers, and their heads and limbs were bandaged as are those of the wounded on the field of battle. Then they were laid in the ambulances, and drawn from the ground. For hours, soldiers are drilled to disencumber themselves of their knapsacks, and place them quickly in position again upon the person.

Our ministers who have gone to important places to hold tent-meetings have often made a serious mistake in devoting all their time to sermonizing.

Sin has marred the divine image in man, but through Christ this may be restored. But it is only through earnest prayer and the conquest of self that we can become partakers of the divine nature. Many do not rise high enough to meet the standard. Their faith is weak, they expect but little from God, and they receive according to their faith.

Did they but realize how near is the end of all work for the salvation of souls, they would sacrifice their possessions as freely as did the members of the early church.

How much has been thoughtlessly wasted by our youth, spent for self-indulgence and display, for that which they would have been just as happy without. Every dollar which we possess is the Lord's.
