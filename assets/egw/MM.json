Never before in the history of the human family have these great questions received the earnest, intensive, scientific study and wide publicity that are being given them at the present hour. Medical science in all its ramifications has made marvelous progress during the last half century. It would require a volume to enumerate and explain the discoveries, the development, and achievement, that have been made in this great department of human interest and welfare. The knowledge that has been gained in the exhaustive study of these fundamental subjects has been given to the public in highly scientific and technical volumes, and in simpler form in books, magazines, newspapers, and lectures."},{"refcode_short":"MM v.2","refcode_long":"Medical Ministry, p. v.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"This volume, entitled Medical Ministry, is one more valuable contribution to the world's needs in the domain of physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. It is unique in its scope. It recognizes and commends the truly scientific in the causes and treatment of diseases.

And obedience to moral law, it is urged, can be rendered only through the acceptance of, and union with, Christ, the redeemer of man ruined through transgression.

This instruction is not technical. It can be understood by laymen. The requirements laid down for spiritual, mental, and physical health and happiness are so rational that they can be complied with.

G. White, devoted nearly seventy years of her very earnest, active life to the gospel ministry. In her youth she was an invalid. In her early married life she battled with a weak heart, with cancer, and with other ailments. At the age of thirty-six she experienced a great awakening on the subject of temperance as it relates to health, to physical and mental efficiency, and to Christian living. The rigid application of the knowledge gained regarding the laws of mind and body brought great relief and restoration to her, and from that time on to the close of her arduous labors, a period of nearly fifty years, she was an earnest exponent of the principles of health and temperance."},{"refcode_short":"MM vi.2","refcode_long":"Medical Ministry, p. vi.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In 1865 Mrs. E. G. White made an appeal to the Seventh-day Adventist Church, of which she was a member, to establish a medical institution in which the sick should be given rational, drugless treatment for their ills, and also where they should be given instruction regarding the laws of health. In response, such an institution was established in Battle Creek, Michigan. This undertaking met with great success. The institution grew into large proportions, and for nearly a half century it has been favorably and widely known as the Battle Creek Sanitarium. Through subsequent years many similar sister sanitariums have been established in different parts of the United States and in many other countries of the world."},{"refcode_short":"MM vi.3","refcode_long":"Medical Ministry, p. vi.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The Trustees of Mrs. White's Estate, having found in her letters and manuscript files many documents heretofore unpublished which contain valuable instruction for physicians, nurses, sanitarium managers, helpers, gospel evangelists, and Christian workers, believe that this valuable counsel should be sent forth to the public.

Hilliard, at Otsego, Mich., June 6, 1863, that the great subject of health reform was opened before me in vision.”—The Review and Herald, October 8, 1867.

In each was one article from the pen of Ellen G. White, running under the title, “Disease and its Causes.” Appearing with Mrs. White's article was related material drawn from the writings of physicians and ministers, and articles especially prepared by James White and others for these pamphlets. Each was devoted to a fundamental health theme: diet, marriage and home life, the use of drugs, care of the sick and hygiene, child care and attire for children, and healthful dress. In 1899 and 1900, the six Ellen G. White messages were published as a series of continued articles in the Review and Herald.

Many of her manuscript documents, addressed to physicians, institutional managers, nurses, and sanitarium families embody counsels of vital importance. Copies of these were kept on file. Many of the counsels give direction to the medical work. Others, written at crucial times in the development of phases of our medical work, sound warnings.

In many lands, medical missions are to be established to act as God's helping hand in ministering to the afflicted."},{"refcode_short":"MM 331.1","refcode_long":"Medical Ministry, p. 331.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Christ cooperates with those who engage in medical missionary work. Men and women who unselfishly do what they can to establish sanitariums and treatment rooms in many lands will be richly rewarded. Those who visit these institutions will be benefited physically, mentally, and spiritually—the weary will be refreshed, the sick restored to health, the sin-burdened relieved. In far-off countries, from those whose hearts are by these agencies turned from the service of sin unto righteousness, will be heard thanksgiving and the voice of melody. By their songs of grateful praise a testimony will be borne that will win others to allegiance and to fellowship with Christ.—Counsels on Health, 215."},{"refcode_short":"MM 331","refcode_long":"Medical Ministry, p. 331 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Go Forward"},{"refcode_short":"MM 331.2","refcode_long":"Medical Ministry, p. 331.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"When I think of the history of our work during the past ten years I can but say, See what the Lord hath wrought.

There should be one hundred workers actively engaged in personal missionary work where now there is but one. Time is rapidly passing.

There are great blessings in store for those who fully surrender to the call of God.

Oh, how I long to see church members clothed with their beautiful garments, and prepared to go forth to meet the Bridegroom!

That which we receive from Christ we must give to others. Just as surely as we receive, so surely must we give. None who receive the grace of Christ can keep it to themselves. As soon as Christ becomes an abiding presence in the heart, we shall not be able to see souls perishing in ignorance of the truth and be at rest.

If we will work in harmony with one another and with heaven, God will demonstrate His power in our behalf as He did for the disciples on the Day of Pentecost. Those days of preparation, in which the disciples prepared themselves by prayer and a putting away of all disunion, brought them into such close relation to God that He could work for them and through them in a marvelous manner.
