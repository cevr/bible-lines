In consequence of our limited ideas of the sufferings of Christ, we place a low estimate upon the great work of the atonement. The glorious plan of man's salvation was brought about through the infinite love of God the Father. In this divine plan is seen the most marvelous manifestation of the love of God to the fallen race. Such love as is manifested in the gift of God's beloved Son amazed the holy angels. “God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” This Saviour was the brightness of his Father's glory, and the express image of his person. He possessed divine majesty, perfection and excellence. He was equal with God. “It pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell.” “Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men. And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.”"},{"refcode_short":"T17 1.2","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 17, p. 1.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Christ consented to die in man's stead that man, by a life of obedience, might escape the penalty of the transgression of the law of God. The death of Christ did not make the law of God of none effect. His death did not slay the law, lessen its holy claims, nor detract from its sacred dignity. The death of Christ proclaimed the justice and perpetuity of his Father's law in punishing the transgressor, in that he consented to suffer the penalty of the law himself, in order to save fallen man from its curse. The death of God's beloved Son on the cross shows the immutability of the law of God. His death magnified the law and made it honorable, and gave evidence to man of its changeless character. From his own divine lips is heard, “I came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill.” The death of Christ justified the claims of the law."},{"refcode_short":"T17 2.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 17, p. 2.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In Christ was united the human and the divine. His mission was to reconcile God to man, and man to God; to unite the finite with the infinite. This was the only way in which fallen men could be exalted through the merits of the blood of Christ, to be partakers of the divine nature. Taking human nature, fitted Christ to understand the nature of man's trials, and his sorrows, and all the temptations wherewith he is beset. Angels who were unacquainted with sin could not sympathize with man in his peculiar trials. Christ condescended to take man's nature. He was tempted in all points like as we, that he might know how to succor all who should be tempted."},{"refcode_short":"T17 2.2","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 17, p. 2.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"As the human was upon him, he felt his need of strength from his Father. He had select places of prayer. He loved the solitude of the mountain where to hold communion with his Father in Heaven. In this exercise, his holy, human soul was strengthened for the duties and trials of the day. Our Saviour identifies himself with our needs and weaknesses, in that he became a suppliant, a nightly petitioner, seeking from his Father fresh supplies of strength, to come forth invigorated and refreshed, braced for duty and trial. He is our example in all things. He is a brother in our infirmities, but not possessing like passions. As the sinless One his nature recoiled from evil. He endured struggles, and torture of soul, in a world of sin. His humanity made prayer a necessity, and privilege. He required all the stronger divine support and comfort which his Father was ready to impart to his Son, who had left the joys of Heaven, chose his home, for the benefit of man, in a cold and thankless world. Christ found comfort and joy in communion with his Father. Here he could unburden his sorrows that were crushing him. He was a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with grief."},{"refcode_short":"T17 3.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 17, p. 3.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Through the day he labored earnestly to do good to others, to save men from destruction. He healed the sick, he comforted the mournful, and brought cheerfulness and hope to the despairing. He brought the dead to life. After his work was finished for the day, he went forth, evening after evening, away from the confusion of the city, and his form was bowed in some retired grove, in supplication to his Father. At times the bright beams of the moon shone upon his bowed form. And then again the clouds and darkness shut away all light. The dew and frost of night rested upon his head and beard while in the attitude of a suppliant. He frequently continued his petitions through the entire night. He is our example. If we could remember this, and imitate the pattern, we should be much stronger in God."},{"refcode_short":"T17 4.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 17, p. 4.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"If the Saviour of men, with his divine strength, felt the need of prayer, how much more should feeble, sinful mortals, feel the necessity of prayer,—fervent, constant, prayer? When Christ was the most fiercely beset by temptation, he ate nothing. He committed himself to God, and through earnest prayer, and perfect submission to the will of his Father, came off conqueror."},{"refcode_short":"T17 4.2","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 17, p. 4.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Those who profess the truth for these last days, above every other class who take the name of Christian, should imitate the great Exemplar in prayer. “It is necessary for the disciple to follow his Master, and enough for the servant to be as his Lord.” Our tables are frequently spread with luxuries not healthful nor necessary, because we love these things more than we love self-denial, freedom from disease, and a sound mind. Jesus sought earnestly for strength from his Father. This he considered, even for himself, the divine Son of God, of more value than to sit at the most luxurious table. He has given us evidence that prayer was essential in order to receive strength to contend with the powers of darkness, and to do the work allotted us to perform. Our own strength is weakness, but the strength which God gives is mighty, and will bring off every one who obtains it, more than conqueror."},{"refcode_short":"T17 4.3","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 17, p. 4.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"As the Son of God in the garden of Gethsemane bowed in the attitude of prayer, the agony of his spirit forced from his pores sweat like great drops of blood. It was here that the horror of great darkness surrounded him. The sins of the world were upon him. He was suffering in man's stead as a transgressor of his Father's law. Here was the scene of temptation. The divine light of God was receding from his vision, and he was passing into the hands of the powers of darkness. In the agony of his soul-anguish, he lay prostrate on the cold earth. He was realizing his Father's frown. The cup of suffering, Christ had taken from the lips of guilty man and proposed to drink it himself, and in its place, give to man the cup of blessing. The wrath that would have fallen upon man, was now falling upon Christ. It was here the mysterious cup trembled in his hand."},{"refcode_short":"T17 5.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 17, p. 5.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Jesus had often resorted to Gethsemane with his disciples for meditation and prayer. They were all well acquainted with this sacred retreat. Even Judas knew where to lead the murderous throng, that he might betray Jesus into their hands. Never before had the Saviour visited the spot with a heart so full of sorrow. It was not bodily suffering from which the Son of God shrank, and which wrung from his lips, in the presence of his disciples, these mournful words: “My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death.” “Tarry ye here,” said he, “and watch with me.”"},{"refcode_short":"T17 5.2","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 17, p. 5.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"He went a little distance from his disciples, leaving them within hearing of his voice, and fell on his face, and prayed. His soul was agonized, and he plead, “O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.” The sins of a lost world were upon him, and overwhelmed him. It was a sense of his Father's frown, in consequence of sin, which rent the heart of the Son of God with such piercing agony, and forced the great blood-drops from his brow down his pale cheeks, falling to the ground, and moistening the earth."},{"refcode_short":"T17 6.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 17, p. 6.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"He rose from his prostrate position, and came to his disciples, and found them asleep. He said unto Peter, “What! could ye not watch with me one hour? Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.” At the most important time, the disciples were found sleeping—at the time when Jesus had made a special request for them to watch with him. He knew that severe conflicts and terrible temptations were before his disciples. He took them with him, that they might be a strength to him, and that the events they should witness that night, and the lessons of instruction they should receive, might be indelibly printed upon their memories. This was necessary, that their faith might not fail, but be strengthened for the test just before them."},{"refcode_short":"T17 6.2","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 17, p. 6.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"But instead of watching with Christ, they were burdened with sorrow, and fell asleep. Even the ardent Peter was asleep, who, only a few hours before, had declared that he would Suffer, and, if need be, die for his Lord. At the most critical moment, when the Son of God was in need of their sympathy and heartfelt prayers, they were found asleep. They lost much by thus sleeping. Our Saviour designed to fortify them for the severe test of their faith to which they would soon be subjected. If they had spent the mournful period in watching with the dear Saviour, and in prayer to God, Peter would not have been left to his own feeble strength to have denied his Lord in the time of trial."},{"refcode_short":"T17 7.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 17, p. 7.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The Son of God went away the second time, and prayed, saying, “O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it, thy will be done.” And again he came to his disciples, and found them sleeping. Their eyes were heavy. By these sleeping disciples is represented a sleeping church when the day of God's visitation is nigh. It is a time of clouds and thick darkness, when to be found asleep is most perilous."},{"refcode_short":"T17 7.2","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 17, p. 7.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Jesus has warned: “Watch ye therefore; for ye know not when the Master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning; lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.” The church of God is required to fulfill her night watch, however perilous, whether long or short. Sorrow is no excuse for her to be less watchful. Tribulation should not lead to carelessness, but to double vigilance. Christ has directed the church by his own example to the Source of their strength in times of need, distress, and peril. The attitude of watching is to designate the church as God's people indeed. By this sign the waiting ones are distinguished from the world, and show that they are pilgrims and strangers upon the earth."},{"refcode_short":"T17 7.3","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 17, p. 7.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The Saviour turned sadly the second time from his sleeping disciples, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. Then he came to them, and said, “Sleep on now, and take your rest; behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.” How cruel for the disciples to permit sleep to close their eyes and slumber to chain their senses, while their divine Lord was enduring such inexpressible mental anguish. If they had remained watching, they would not have lost their faith as they beheld the Son of God dying upon the cross. This important night-watch should have been signalized by noble mental struggles and prayers, which would have brought them strength to witness the unspeakable agony of the Son of God. It would have prepared them, as they should behold his sufferings upon the cross, to understand something of the nature of the overpowering anguish which he endured in the garden of Gethsemane. And they would have been better able to recall the words he had spoken to them in reference to his sufferings, death, and resurrection; and amid the gloom of that terrible, trying hour, some rays of hope would have lit up the darkness, and sustained their faith.

He became sin for the fallen race. The sense of the withdrawal of his Father's love pressed from his anguished soul these words: “My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death.” “If it be possible, let this cup pass from me.” Then with entire submission to his Father's will, he adds, “Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.”"},{"refcode_short":"T17 9.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 17, p. 9.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The divine Son of God was fainting, dying.

Behold the patient sufferer! Upon his head is the thorny crown. His life-blood flows from every lacerated vein. All this in consequence of sin!

Behold the oppressor and the oppressed. A vast multitude enclose the Saviour of the world. Mocking and jeering are mingled with the coarse oaths of blasphemy. His lowly birth and his humble life are commented upon by unfeeling wretches. His claim to be the Son of God is ridiculed by the chief priests and elders, and the vulgar jest and insulting derision are passed from lip to lip. Satan was having full control of the minds of his servants. In order to do this effectually, he commences with the chief priests and the elders, and imbues them with a religious frenzy. They are actuated by the same Satanic spirit which moves the most vile and hardened wretches. There is a corrupt harmony in the feelings of all, from the hypocritical priests and ciders down to the most debased. Christ, the precious Son of God, was led forth, and the cross was laid upon his shoulders. At every step was left blood which flowed from his wounds. Thronged by an immense crowd of bitter enemies and unfeeling spectators, he is led away to the crucifixion. “He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth.

Close to the cross are the blind, bigoted, faithless priests and elders, taunting, mocking, and jeering: “Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross. Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. He trusted in God, let him deliver him now, if he will have him; for he said, I am the Son of God.” Not one word did Jesus answer to all this. While the nails were being driven through his hands, and the sweat-drops of agony were forced from his pores, from the pale, quivering lips of the innocent sufferer a prayer of pardoning love was breathed for his murderers: “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” All Heaven was gazing with profound interest upon the scene. The glorious Redeemer of a lost world was suffering the penalty of man's transgressions of the Father's law. He was about to ransom his people with his own blood.

The displeasure of the Father for sin, and its penalty which was death, was all that he could realize through this amazing darkness.

The Redeemer of the world then relied upon the evidences which had hitherto strengthened him, that his Father accepted his labors and was pleased with his work. In his dying agony, as he yields up his precious life, he has by faith alone to trust in Him whom it has ever been his joy to obey. He is not cheered with clear, bright rays of hope on the right hand nor on the left. All is enshrouded in oppressive gloom. Amid the awful darkness which is felt by sympathizing nature, the Redeemer drains the mysterious cup even to its dregs. Denied even bright hope and confidence in the triumph which will be his in the future, he cries with a loud voice, “Lord, into thy hands I commit my spirit.” He is acquainted with the character of his Father, his justice, his mercy, and great love. In submission he drops into the hands of his Father. Amid the convulsions of nature are heard, by the amazed spectators, the dying words of the Man of Calvary. Nature sympathized with the suffering of its Author. The heaving earth, the rent rocks, proclaimed that it was the Son of God who died. There was a mighty earthquake. The vail of the temple was rent in twain. Terror seized the executioners and spectators as they beheld the sun vailed in darkness, and felt the earth shake beneath them, and saw and heard the rending of the rocks. The mocking and laughing of the chief priests and elders was hushed as Christ commended his spirit into the hands of his Father. The astonished throng began to withdraw, and grope their way, in the darkness, to the city. They smote upon their breasts as they went, and in terror, speaking scarcely above a whisper, said among themselves, “It is an innocent person that has been murdered.

The scenes of Calvary call for the deepest emotion. Upon this subject you will be excusable if you manifest enthusiasm. That Christ, so excellent, so innocent, should suffer such a painful death, bearing the weight of the sins of the world, our most extended thoughts and imaginations can never be able to fully reach, and enable us to comprehend the length, the breadth, the height, the depth, of such amazing love. The contemplation of the matchless depths of a Saviour's love, viewed by faith, fills and absorbs the mind, touches and melts the soul, refines and elevates the affections, and completely transforms the whole character. The language of the apostle is, “I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified.” We may look toward Calvary, and also exclaim, “God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.”"},{"refcode_short":"T17 16.2","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 17, p. 16.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Considering at what an immense cost our salvation has been purchased, what will be the fate of those who neglect so great a salvation?

Many have suffered death by slow tortures; others have suffered death by crucifixion. In what does the death of God's dear Son differ from these? It is true he died upon the cross a most cruel death; yet others, for his dear sake, have suffered equally, as far as bodily torture is concerned. Why was the suffering of Christ more dreadful than that of other persons who have yielded their lives for his sake? If the sufferings of Christ consisted in physical pain alone, then his death was no more painful than that of some of the martyrs. Bodily pain was but an item in the excruciating agony of God's dear Son. The sins of the world were upon him, also the sense of his Father's wrath as he suffers the penalty of the law transgressed. It was these that crushed his divine soul. It was the hiding of his Father's face, a sense that his own dear Father had forsaken him, which brought despair. The separation that sin makes between God and man was fully realized and keenly felt by the innocent, suffering Man of Calvary, without one ray of light to brighten the future, oppressed by the powers of darkness, struggling with the power of Satan,—he declaring that Christ was in his power, that he was superior in strength to the Son of God, that God had disowned his Son, and that he was no longer in the favor of God any more than himself.

Christian zeal which is controlled by principle is not spasmodic. It is earnest, deep, and strong, engaging the whole soul, awakening to exercise the moral sensibilities. The salvation of souls and the interests of the kingdom of God are matters of the highest importance. What earthly object is there that would make it more reasonable to be in earnest than the salvation of souls and the glory of God? There are considerations here which cannot be lightly regarded. They are as weighty as eternity. Eternal destinies are at stake. Men and women are deciding for weal or woe. Christian zeal will not exhaust itself in talk, but will feel and act with vigor and efficiency. Yet Christian zeal will not act for the sake of being seen.

Those who give themselves up to their stinginess and selfishness, are accountable for their niggardly acts, and are responsible for the talents they abuse.

These deceive themselves. The mere possession of qualities, and yet not using them, only increases their responsibility; and if they keep their Master's talents unimproved, or hoarded, their condition is no better than their neighbors for whom their souls feel such contempt.

Heaven, which possessed no charms, is now viewed in its riches and glory; and he contemplates it as his future home, where he shall see, love, and praise Him who hath redeemed him by his precious blood. The works of holiness which appeared wearisome, are now his delight. The word of God, which was dull and uninteresting, is now chosen as his study, the man of his counsel.

The parents fear they will overwork, and therefore bear burdens themselves which their children should bear. Overwork is bad; but the result of indolence is more to be dreaded. Idleness leads to the indulgence of corrupt habits. Industry does not weary and exhaust one-fifth part as much as the pernicious habit of self-abuse. If simple, well-regulated labor exhausts your children, be assured, parents, there is a cause, aside from their labor, which is enervating their systems, and producing a sense of constant weariness. Give your children physical labor, which will call into exercise the nerves and muscles. The weariness attending such labor will lessen their inclination to indulge in vicious habits. Idleness is a curse. It produces licentious habits."},{"refcode_short":"T17 188.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 17, p. 188.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Many cases have been presented before me, and I have been let into their inner lives.

Our sympathies were enlisted for a brother who was a great sufferer with the phthisic. He was pale and emaciated. He requested the prayers of the people of God. He said that his family were sick, and that he had lost a child. He spoke, with feeling, of his bereavement. He said that he had been waiting for some time to see Bro. and Sr. White. He had believed that if they would pray for him, he would be healed. After the meeting closed, the brethren called our attention to the case. They said that the church was assisting them. His wife was sick, and his child had died. The brethren had met at his house, and united in praying for the afflicted family. We were much worn, and had the burden of labor upon us during the meeting, and wished to be excused."},{"refcode_short":"T17 189.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 17, p. 189.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"I had resolved not to engage in prayer for any one, unless the Spirit of the Lord should dictate in the matter. I had been shown that there was so much iniquity abounding, even among professed Sabbath-keepers, that I did not wish to unite in prayer for those of whose history I had no knowledge. I stated my reason. I was assured by brethren that, as far as they knew, he was a worthy brother. I conversed a few words with the one who had solicited our prayers that he might be healed. I could not feel free. He wept. Said he had waited for us to come, and felt assured that if we would pray for him he would be restored to health. We told him we were unacquainted with his life; that we had rather those who knew him would pray for him. He importuned us so earnestly that we decided to consider his case, and present it before the Lord that night; and if the way seemed all clear, we would comply with his request. That night we bowed before God and presented his case before him. We entreated that we might know the will of God concerning him. All we desired was that God might be glorified. Would the Lord have us pray for this afflicted man? We left the burden with the Lord, and retired to rest. In a dream the case of that brother was clearly presented. His course from his childhood up was shown, and if we should pray, the Lord would not hear us; for he regarded iniquity in his heart. The next morning the brother came for us to pray for him. We took him aside, and told him we were sorry to be compelled to refuse his request. I related my dream, which he acknowledged was true. He had practiced self-abuse from his boyhood up. He had continued the practice during his married life. He said he would try to break himself of this sin. This man had a long-established habit to overcome. He was in the middle age of life. His moral principles were so weak when brought in conflict with long-established indulgence, that they were overcome. The animal had gained the ascendency over the higher nature. I asked him in regard to health reform. He could not live it, he said. His wife would throw graham flour out of doors, if it was brought into the house. This man had been helped by the church. Prayer also, had been offered in their behalf. Their child had died, and the wife was sick, and the husband and father would leave his case upon us, for us to bring before a pure and holy God, that he might work a miracle for him and make him well. The moral sensibilities of this man were benumbed."},{"refcode_short":"T17 190.1","refcode_long":"Testimony for the Church — No. 17, p. 190.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"When the young adopt vile practices while the spirit is tender, they will never obtain force to develop, fully and correctly, physical, intellectual, and moral character. Here was a man debasing himself daily, and yet, dares to venture into the presence of God, and ask an increase of strength which he has vilely squandered, and which if granted, he will consume upon his lust. What forbearance has God! If he should deal with man according to his corrupt ways before him, who could live in his sight? What if we had been less cautious, and carried the case of this man before God while he was practicing iniquity, would the Lord have heard? would he have answered? “For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.

If all who profess to obey the law of God were free from iniquity, my soul would be relieved; but they are not. Even some who profess to keep all the commandments of God are guilty of the sin of adultery. What can I say to arouse the benumbed sensibilities? Moral principle strictly carried out, becomes the only safeguard of the soul. If ever there was a time when the diet should be of the most simple kind, it is now. Meat should not be placed before our children. Its influence is to excite and increase the force of the lower passions, and has a tendency to deaden the moral or higher powers. Grains and fruits prepared free from grease, and in as natural a condition as possible, should be the food for the tables of all who claim to be preparing for translation to Heaven. The less feverish the diet, the more easily can the passions be controlled.
