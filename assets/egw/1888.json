White 1888 Materials consists exclusively of Ellen G. White letters, manuscripts, articles, and sermons that relate directly or indirectly to the Ministerial Institute and General Conference session held by Seventh-day Adventists in Minneapolis, Minnesota, from October 10 to November 4, 1888. No General Conference session in the history of the Seventh-day Adventist church has undergone such analysis and scrutiny, or has elicited as much comment as the 1888 meeting."},{"refcode_short":"1888 3.2","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

White. Mrs. White had much to say at the time, and in later years as well, about her experience in Minneapolis. In the decade following 1888, she frequently referred to Minneapolis and the spirit that was manifested there."},{"refcode_short":"1888 3.3","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Thus the Trustees are making available to our church members this comprehensive collection of all the E. G. White manuscripts and letters that in any way refer to Minneapolis. In most cases the entire manuscript or letter has been included even though only a portion may be germane to this subject. Names have been left in just as Ellen White used them, except in one or two instances where the file copy has a blank instead of a name."},{"refcode_short":"1888 3.4","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

V. Olson, they are repeated here. One sermon and portions of another not found in Thirteen Crisis Years have been added as well.

While the workers meeting was in session, it was a question with me and my friends who attended me, whether I should ever rise from my severe attack of sickness. I felt no desire to recover. I had no power even to pray, and no desire to live. Rest, only rest, was my desire, quiet and rest. As I lay for two weeks in nervous prostration, I had hope that no one would beseech the throne of grace in my behalf. When the crises came, it was the impression that I would die, and this was my thought. But it was not the will of my heavenly Father. My work was not yet done. Word came from Oakland that a special season of prayer was held in my behalf in order to plead that the Lord would raise me up and give me strength to attend the meeting. I had been confined to my bed for two weeks. The members of the household could not see any decided improvement, and they said there was no hope of my recovery unless the Lord would work in my behalf. But they decided that if I would consent to go to Oakland from my sick bed, the Lord would renew my strength. In answer to their solicitations, I was taken to the cars Sept. 21, and a bed was made upon the seats, and I was strengthened to endure the journey.

The spirit of opposition to the testimony would arise, and some one would say, “Some one is influencing Sister White: some one has been telling her about my case.” The brethren did not seem to see beyond the instrument. Unbelief and resistance to reproof prevailed everywhere. Such gross blindness, such a want of recognition as to where the spirit of the Lord was working, I had never before witnessed in so marked a manner among our own people. I had been instructed in regard to many evils that had been coming in among us while I was in Europe, and had written what was the mind of the Lord in reference to them. I had also been told that the testimony God had given me would not be received, because the hearts of those who had been reproved were not in such a state of humility that they could be corrected and receive reproof. Satan had been at work east of the Rocky Mountains as well as west, to make of none effect the messages of reproof and warning, as well as the lessons of Christ, and the messages of consolation. The evil one was determined to cut off the light which God had for his people, that every man might walk in his own light and follow his own judgment, and no voice be heard, saying, “Why do ye so?” A strong, firm, resistance was manifested by many against anything that should interfere with their own personal ideas, their own course of action.

The opinions of finite men, erring like themselves, had greater influence over their minds than the spirit of God that searched the depths of the heart. The Spirit of truth was not their wisdom and their salvation. Because of unbelief, they could not find peace and rest in Jesus, who had invited, “Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” They had not kept the way of the Lord, and fear and anxiety brought a burden upon their souls. They had forgotten him who seeth in secret. Their ways were right in their own eyes.

He went to a retired place and sought the Lord, There the Lord in his great goodness and loving kindness drew nigh to him, and he came back to the camp-ground entirely changed in spirit. He declared that the Lord had shown him himself, that he must be a converted man or he would be lost. He was willing to go into the congregation at once and confess his sins, and his backsliding from God. He was advised that this was not wisdom, and would not result in glorifying God, but would give our enemies occasion to cast reflections upon the whole ministry. It is Satan's object to ensnare men who handle sacred things, that he may lead them to do things that will bring the ministry down on a level with common things, so that sinners may be furnished with an excuse for their own impenitence and sin. When the words and the deportment of the minister are not after Christ's example, but are in imitation of the words and ways of the great deceiver, our enemies have occasion to blaspheme.

This meeting was indeed precious. I was strengthened to labor in that meeting. I heard the confessions of E.P. Daniels and his wife. I heard their earnest supplications to God. I know that the spirit of God was doing its work upon their hearts. I heard them testify that the Lord had given them a blessing such as they had never before received. They declared that they were indeed receiving afresh the converting power of God, and many testimonies of confession, and of victories gained were then made. Could our eyes have been opened, we could have seen Jesus in our midst with his holy angels. Many felt his grace and his presence in rich measure. With hearts broken by the Spirit of God, confessions of sins were made and precious testimonies of faith were given that declared that Jesus had pardoned their sin and spoken peace to their souls. This season marked by so much of the power of God to those present, we could never forget. How thankful I felt that the Lord had given me strength to remain till the close of that meeting. He gave me a spirit of supplication. My faith fastened upon the promises of God, and our prayers were answered, for there was the revealing of his presence, and his power."},{"refcode_short":"1888 58.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

White 1888 Materials, p. 59.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"The enemy had laid a snare for the Fresno church. Brethren had left the churches where they belonged and where their help was greatly needed to strengthen and encourage the weak churches, and had moved into Fresno, to add their presence and increase the numbers of the church at that place. If they cannot hear the voice of God saying, “What doest thou here Elijah?”, God will speak more plainly. It is not God's plan to have men of the same faith colonize and dwell together. We are living in the last days, and unless God moves the men, this moving mania will prove a snare perhaps to the loss of souls of those who move, as well as to the loss of many souls left discouraged in the small churches. The land boom struck Fresno, and these good brethren in the faith were swept into the land speculation and some invested in mining stock. Speculation crowded out thoughts of eternal things. Unwary souls were beguiled and became infatuated. On the street, around the table, in the social visit, the theme of conversation was the purchasing of lots and mining stock. This, also, was the conversation of ministers whose business it was to work the mines of truth, to find and rescue the precious gems and jewels hidden beneath the rubbish of error. Just such a chapter is found in the history of the old world, when every imagination of man's heart was only evil and that continually. So it was in the city of Sodom. When men who have had great light and great truth, who are to be God's witnesses to a people whose interests are in the world, become full of a feverish anxiety to buy and sell and get gain, Satan looks on with triumph. These men permit the alluring pictures of the world to captivate their senses; the alluring temptation with which Satan tempted Christ, overcomes them and the example of Christ in resisting temptation fades from the memory. They permit themselves to be drawn into the current which is sweeping man downward, and when Satan sees his plans work so well, he invents scheme after scheme, that the Lord's money may be diverted into channels where the cause of God will get none of it. Satan tells the speculator that if he will engage in this land scheme, he can make means to help the cause of God, and he presents illusions that fascinates the senses and thousands of dollars are bound away from the cause of God, and the example of Christ is not followed. Unwary souls are beguiled by representations that will never be realized. All who engage in enterprises of this order, fail to give a worthy, Christ-like example to the world as Seventh-day Adventists. Satan designed to cut off the influence of the men who by precept and example, should have borne a clear, unselfish, uncorrupted testimony against all such schemes of the enemy. Against such Satanic schemes, there is no safeguard but one—the truth as it is in Jesus, planted in the heart by his spirit, and nurtured by his grace. Our piety, Bible integrity, our religion, will degenerate into commonness and earthiness before the world, before the God whom we profess to love and serve, if we do not keep a living connection with Christ. We claim to be the repositories of sacred truth, to be looking for the glorious appearing of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory."},{"refcode_short":"1888 61.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Those who engage in speculation cannot keep the commandments of God in sincerity and in truth. The sacredness of the truth is marred by selfish interests, and in the judgment it will be seen that the words of reproof and warning, spoken by the minister who engaged in worldly schemes, pleased the people, but did not convict and convert them, for did they not see the same world-loving spirit in him who claimed to believe we are having the last message of warning to be given to the world that the last message of warning was going to the world, as in themselves.

They were building walls that would make the truth of none effect to those to whom it should be presented. I was praying earnestly when Elder Daniels was laboring in Fresno that the Lord would work through his servant to his own name's glory. If the Lord has laid on Elder Daniels a work to do for the church, those for whom he labored, not [to] look to the instrument, but to God who works through him. The Lord sent Gideon to do a special work, and he said to Gideon, “Go in this thy might.” He directed Gideon to the strength that was back of his own strength, as if he said to Gideon, I have chosen thee to do an errand for me, in this I have regarded thee graciously, and let this be encouragement, because thou hast found grace in the eyes of the Lord. Go in thy strength and conquer. We were glad that the fruits of the work in Fresno bore evidence that God was dealing with human minds. The Lord wrought upon hearts. Humble confessions were made and the work of restitution that was done, bore witness to the genuineness of the work. It may be that some did not bring forth the fruits of thorough repentance. There was some close, testing work to be done if the plough share of truth went deep enough to break up the fallow ground of the heart. The testimony of many, was, “I have never seen it on this wise before.” The evidence was of a character that no one could doubt but that the work was of God. Confessions of sins were made, and like Zacchaeus, souls were impressed to say, “If I have taken aught from any man, I will restore him four fold.” This work of making things right as far as human power could, was in the order of God."},{"refcode_short":"1888 63.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G. White 1888 Materials, p. 63.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"It is not agreeable to the human heart to do right. The spirit is in warfare against the flesh, but restitution will be made if the work goes forward as God shall direct. The work of true repentance goes deeper than the surface, and we discern and acknowledge the wisdom and power of God in this manifestation. As the work progressed, that faith which works by love and purifies the soul, yielded its precious harvest of fruit. The language of the church in Fresno was, “Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God, that we might know the things which are freely given to us of God, which things also we speak not in the words which man teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.” We praise the Lord with heart and pen and voice for this good work which has been wrought in Fresno. What a powerful, gracious, and effectual call this has been to Fresno. Precious Redeemer, thy grace was not given because of any man's merit nor as the result of any man's worth or righteousness, but the righteousness of Christ. The Sin-pardoning Saviour was holding forth the golden scepter of his matchless grace and mercy to wayward sinful souls. We hope and pray that the good work may continue When Matthew was called to follow the Lord, he dropped his former occupation as a publican, and engaged in the service of the Master. He invited Jesus to his home. No sooner did Jesus open the heart of Matthew, than he opened his house as a home for Jesus. Let the same proofs of the good work of God be manifested in the same way by our brethren in Fresno. Take Jesus home to your hearts, to your houses, and present him to your neighbors. Let your families, your children, see the sweet grace of Christ at work in your hearts, and exemplified in your characters. Let the efficacy of the blood of Christ avail in your behalf, and his righteousness become your righteousness. Let a living testimony be borne from every church member, “Oh come hither, and hearken, all ye that love the Lord, and I will tell thee what he hath done for my soul.” The simplicity of the religion of Jesus is to be revealed to the world. Christ must be all and in all, fully satisfying every want of the soul. Let not your minds be entangled in worldly schemes, but dig deep in the mines of God's word for the precious gems of truth which are there. Christ will qualify you to be partakers of his grace. You may improve the talents he has entrusted to you. You are to go forth with weeping to sow the precious grains of truth, for doubtless, you will return again with rejoicing bringing your sheaves with you. But in behalf of Christ, I warn you to flatter no man. It is Satan's plan to flatter the pride of our natures, and we are in danger of shutting out Christ, his blood, his righteousness, and placing man where Jesus Christ should be. This is our constant danger. Let Christ be lifted up before the people, acknowledge his power, revealed through the instrument in doing a good work, but let all the glory be given back to God. Grace always humbles the receiver. It never exalts man. The grace of Christ is to be recognized and exalted; but sinful man never. Rejoice with trembling, nevertheless, rejoice."},{"refcode_short":"1888 66","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

We may have joy unspeakable and full of glory. Let us put away our indolence and study God's Word more constantly. If we ever needed the Holy Ghost to be with us, if we ever needed to preach in the demonstration of the Spirit, it is at this very time. If we will not work without it now, we shall have it in every emergency in the future, and be prepared for what is coming upon the earth. We need to dwell more upon present truth and the preparation essential in order that sinners may be saved. If the Spirit of God works with our efforts, we shall be called out not only to present repentance in its true light but pardon also, and to point to the cleansing fountain where all pollution may be washed away."},{"refcode_short":"1888 72.2","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

If we have the truth abiding in the heart, we shall be growing up to the full stature of men and women in Christ Jesus. Let us think of these things more earnestly. Let there be no more cramping of the intellect. There are greater wonders to be opened to our senses, consistent with the progress of the work. The mystery of revelation challenges investigation, for there are mines of truth to be opened to God's people. We must put off self-righteousness, we must reach loftier heights. God will direct the soul action if we seek the righteousness of Christ so that God can be pleased with our efforts. We want none of self and all of Jesus. The baptism of the Holy Ghost will come upon us at this very meeting if we will have it so. Search for truth as for hidden treasures. The key of knowledge needs to be held in every hand that it may open the storehouse of God's treasury, which contains stores of precious gems of truth.

The foundation of christianity is “Christ our Righteousness.” Men are individually responsible to God and must act as God acts upon them, not as another human mind acts upon their mind; for if this method of indirect influence is kept up, souls can not be impressed and directed by the great I AM. They will, on the other hand, have their experience blended with another, and will be kept under a moral restraint, which allows no freedom of action or of choice."},{"refcode_short":"1888 112.2","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

One man, who has the oversight of a certain line of work, magnifies his responsibilities until his one branch, in his mind, is above every other branch, when in reality all are equally important. When this narrow, selfish idea is received, all his energies are set to imbue the people with the same idea. This is human nature, but not after Christ's order. Just in proportion as this policy is followed, Christ is pushed aside, and self appears prominent.

No one should be accepted as a laborer in the sacred cause of God, until he makes manifest that he has a real, living experience in the things of God.

It is not his will that we should have such a dearth of spirituality. There are some young men that say they have given themselves to the work, who need a genuine experience in the things of God before they are fit to labor in the cause of Christ. Instead of going without the camp, bearing reproach for Christ's sake; instead of seeking the hard places, and trying to bring souls into the truth, these beginners settle themselves in an easy position to visit those who are far advanced in experience. They labor with those who are more capable of teaching them than they are of teaching others. They go from church to church, picking out the easy places, eating and drinking, and suffering others to wait upon them. When you look to see what they have done, there is nothing but leaves.

And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue: and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.

The varying circumstances taking place in our world call for labor which will meet these peculiar developments. The Lord has need of men who are spiritually sharp and clear-sighted, men worked by the Holy Spirit, who are certainly receiving manna fresh from heaven. Upon the minds of such, God's Word flashes light, revealing to them more than ever before the safe path. The Holy Spirit works upon mind and heart. The time has come when through God's messengers the scroll is being unrolled to the world. Instructors in our schools should never be bound about by being told that they are to teach only what has been taught hitherto. Away with these restrictions.* Note: These words were spoken October 21, 1888, to the workers in General Conference session who were giving thoughtful attention to the presentation of truths from God's Word. This was at a time when the absent and ailing president endeavored to restrict such study by a telegram urging that the brethren “stand by the landmarks.” Ellen White ever encouraged careful Bible study, and indicated, as she did in 1892, that “the diligent, prayerful seeker for truth will find precious rays of light yet to shine forth from the word of God.” She also at that time stated: “Many gems are yet scattered that are to be gathered together to become the property of the remnant people of God.”—Counsels on Sabbath School Work, p. 34. In her wholesome discussion of the question of “new light”—and all features of the question must be taken into consideration—she in 1885 said that “the only safety for any of us is in receiving no new doctrine, no new interpretation of the Scriptures, without first submitting it to brethren of experience. Lay it before them in a humble, teachable spirit, with earnest prayer; and if they see no light in it, yield to their judgment; for ‘in the multitude of counselors there is safety.’ ”—Testimonies for the Church 5:293. She explained that the church is responsible for what is taught as the doctrines of the church. She made it clear, as she did in 1907, that “while it is true that the Lord guides individuals, it is also true that He is leading out a people, not a few separate individuals here and there, one believing this thing, and another that.”—Testimonies to Ministers, 488. She warns that “men and women will arise professing to have some new light or some new revelation whose tendency is to unsettle faith in the old landmarks. Their doctrines will not bear the test of God's Word, yet souls will be deceived.”—Testimonies for the Church 5:295 (1885). The fundamental truths held by Seventh-day Adventists, born of diligent and faithful Bible study, and attested by the miracle-working power of the Spirit of God, have stood through the years. In 1900 Ellen White declared: “Eternal truth, which we have adhered to from the beginning, is to be maintained in all its increasing importance to the close of probation.”—Ellen G. White letter 121, 1900. The presentations of 1888, and subsequently, corrected the errors in the thinking of some, and adjusted and led to a balanced emphasis of truth. This experience did not invalidate truth we had earlier accepted. Genuine new light does not provide substitutes for, or cast a shadow on, truth that has gone before. On this point Ellen White wrote in 1905, stating that \"men will arise with interpretations of Scripture which are to them truth, but which are not truth. The truth for this time God has given us as a foundation of our faith. He Himself has taught us what is truth. One will arise, and still another, with new light, which contradicts the light that God has given under the demonstration of His Holy Spirit. . . . We are not to receive the words of those who come with a message that contradicts the special points of our faith.”—Selected Messages, 1:161. And in this connection she declared that “when the power of God testifies as to what is truth, that truth is to stand forever as the truth.”—Ibid. —White Trustees. There is a God to give the message His people shall speak. Let not any minister feel under bonds or be gauged by men's measurement. The gospel must be fulfilled in accordance with the messages God sends. That which God gives His servants to speak today would not perhaps have been present truth twenty years ago, but it is God's message for this time."},{"refcode_short":"1888 133.3","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

At this meeting I bore testimony that the most precious light had been shining forth from the Scriptures in the presentation of the great subject of the righteousness of Christ connected with the law, which should be constantly kept before the sinner as his only hope of salvation. This was not new light to me for it had come to me from higher authority for the last forty-four years, and I had presented it to our people by pen and voice in the testimonies of His Spirit.

It is to be the groundwork of every discourse. There have been dry theories presented and precious souls are starving for the bread of life. This is not the preaching that is required or that the God of heaven will accept, for it is Christless. The divine picture of Christ must be kept before the people. He is that Angel standing in the sun of heaven. He reflects no shadows. Clothed in the attributes of Deity, shrouded in the glories of Deity, and in the likeness of the infinite God, He is to be lifted up before men. When this is kept before the people, creature merit sinks into insignificance. The more the eye looks upon Him, the more His life, His lessons, His perfection of character are studied, the more sinful and abhorrent will sin appear. By beholding, man can but admire and become more attracted to Him, more charmed, and more desirous to be like Jesus until he assimilates to His image and has the mind of Christ.

The lawyer whom Christ found wanting in love to God and to his neighbor which is the very essence of religion could have vindicated himself on the ground of ceremonial correctness. He could have said with Paul that as touching the law he was blameless. But the Lord defines Bible religion as a principle in the soul, not merely the performance of virtuous acts, although virtuous acts are the natural fruits of this principle in the soul. It is the spirit in which the acts are performed rather than the performance that counts with God.

We have the most precious truths ever committed to mortals, and the faith of those who have received these truths should correspond to their greatness and value. There are many who seem to feel that they have a great work to do themselves before they can come to Christ for his salvation. They seem to think that Jesus will come in at the very last of their struggle, and give them help by putting the finishing touch to their life-work. It seems difficult for them to understand that Christ is a complete Saviour, and able to save to the uttermost all that come unto God by him. They lose sight of the fact that Christ himself is “the way, the truth, and the life.” When we individually rest upon Christ, with full assurance of faith, trusting alone to the efficacy of his blood to cleanse from all sin, we shall have peace in believing that what God has promised he is able to perform.

The son spoke his penitence, saying, “Father, I have sinned against Heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: and bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry; for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.” The prodigal made a full confession of his sin.

In this time of peril, as we are nearing the period of an important crisis, it is only reasonable that we should expect something of the revealings of greater light to the people; and how did these men who had allowed their minds to be filled with prejudice and jealousy know but God had made these men messengers to give light and truth to the people? What right had they to set themselves in dead array against these ministers of Christ, even if they thought that their ideas did conflict with previous ideas on some points? Why not spend the hours together in prayer to God, in fasting, in deep heart-searching? “Let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.

His everlasting arms would be beneath me, but I must bear the message the Lord gave me whether men would hear or forbear. I have tried to do this.

They did not then admit their wrong and confess their errors and take their stand firmly for the right. Were they too proud to do this? What has come over our people? I have the same testimonies to bear I ever have borne during the last forty-five years. I did plead that our ministering brethren should act like Christians at Minneapolis, which many of them did not do. You are well aware that the power of God attended the messages I gave to the people but all this is neutralized by hearsay, by the strong feelings that had been worked up and the suggestions made by Elder Butler which suggestions he has no delicacy in making to my face in his letters to me.

A. T. Jones and my work. The next morning I spoke decidedly upon this matter and plainly stated in substance that which I have traced with pen and ink in this letter. Brother Hall, President of Kansas conference arose and said, “My confidence in the testimonies the Lord gives Sister White is confirmed. I was in one of the very rooms she mentions, the very statements made are more clearly pictured than I could possibly describe the incidents myself. Minneapolis was the first general conference that I ever attended. I was but a child in the truth, three years old. I had implicit confidence in my ministering brethren. I believed them to be conscientiously doing their work. I looked up to them, trusted in them, respected them, but the remarks I listened to day after day did make an impression upon my mind. I bore this talk, thinking it must be so but it became too strong for me and on one occasion I just boiled over. I told them just what I thought of such talk and the manifestation of such a spirit. For a little time it was better but whenever something fresh would come up all and more was repeated. I said if this was a sample of the spirit brought into the General Conference, I never desired to attend another.” He humbly confessed that he did become carried away with the current for which he heartily repented. Bro. McReynolds bore testimony that the description given by Sister White was true to the letter. He was unfortunate enough to be one of the number in the room with the Iowa brethren and he was distressed for two weeks. He was not drawn in but the current became too strong and he lost his bearings and confessed he united in the spirit to some degree. He said for two weeks as Sister White has said, there was not a vocal prayer offered in the house. He had before this made humble confessions to me of this matter which he repeated at the meeting. Our meeting had to close before we could go any farther. Young Brother Washburn and his wife came to our tent and talked with me and I talked with them freely and told them if they had come to me I would have gladly explained everything to their satisfaction. Brother Porter came. I talked with him freely and told them not half as much as I have told you when you came to Battle Creek and it helped their minds.

The break came, thank God! My words were not to them as idle tales. Brother Porter, minister from Iowa, arose and said, “I came to this meeting in complete darkness. Satan was at work with me to raise my combative spirit and I was growing darker and darker but I am converted. I see the light. I was not at Minneapolis. If I had been, I fear I should have been the worst among my brethren but I rejoice in God. I see now clearly. I am now determined to work in an opposite direction from that which I have been hitherto working. I want you, my brethren, to forgive me for my blindness and for my stubbornness,” Young Brother Washburn arose and talked quite lengthily. He said when at Minneapolis he was one who thought Sister White's testimony could not be truth when she stated she had had in California no conversation with A.T. Jones and E. J. Waggoner. He did not say that Sister White lied but he might as well said it for he stated to others it could not be so. And he did not believe that Sister White told the truth. But he said, “I confess this to my shame. I have confessed it to Sister White and I confess it to God. I repent of this everlastingly.” He was free in the Lord. Bro. Wakeham was also free to confess he with Brother Conradi were in that room where many ministers made their home and he acted a part in the talking. He had enjoyed more of the blessing of God in the last twenty-four hours than he (had) done in all his life before. Our meeting moved off after this much more freely and the blessing of the Lord rested upon the people. I write you these particulars that you may see if you have done all that you ought to do in regard to the removing the impression you and your ministering brethren have left upon Elder Butler's mind which have misled him and he was, poor man, sick both in body and mind, broken in mind, yet treated as one who was sound and his imaginings as correct as the mind of God."},{"refcode_short":"1888 300.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Ostrander. Would not he be one whose name should be put on the paper as one to run for the presidency of General Conference? This man was even dangerous in his home in his insanity before he left home, for his wife has told me in regard to it. But this man was fully in the confidence of Elder Butler and in his weak condition strong impressions from this man were made on his mind. As Brother Butler stated, my best and most experienced ministering brethren could tell him their hearts were nearly broken at the positions Sister White took at the General Conference. I wish for these ministers’ sake, the breaking of the heart would have been more thorough for then there would be reformation and the mould of God would be upon them in the place of the mould of men. Would that these brethren would be illuminated by the spirit of God rather than to continue longer walking in the sparks of their own kindling.

Since that time, however, Sister T has acknowledged the wrong for which she was reproved.

This wonderful exhibition of God's love was made on the cross of Calvary. Divinity took the nature of humanity, and for what purpose?—That through the righteousness of Christ humanity might partake of the divine nature.

The understanding of the people of God has been blinded; for Satan has misrepresented the character of God. Our good and gracious Lord has been presented before the people clothed in the attributes of Satan, and men and women who have been seeking for truth, have so long regarded God in a false light that it is difficult to dispel the cloud that obscures his glory from their view.

We expected that this commotion in the atmosphere would purify the air; and as I listened to the roll of the thunder, my soul earnestly desired that the power of God might be displayed among the people, that the moral atmosphere also might be purified. On Sabbath, truths were presented that were new to the majority of the congregation. Things new and old were brought forth from the treasure-house of God's word. Truths were revealed which the people were scarcely able to comprehend and appropriate. Light flashed from the oracles of God in relation to the law and the gospel, in relation to the fact that Christ is our righteousness, which seemed to souls who were hungry for truth, as light too precious to be received. But the labors of the Sabbath were not in vain. On Sunday morning there was decided evidence that the Spirit of God was working great changes in the moral and spiritual condition of those assembled. There was a surrendering of the mind and heart to God, and precious testimonies were borne by those who had long been in darkness. One brother spoke of the struggle that he had experienced before he could receive the good news that Christ is our righteousness. The conflict was severe, but the Lord was at work with him, and his mind was changed, and his strength renewed. The Lord presented the truth before him in clear lines, revealing the fact that Christ alone is the source of all hope and salvation. “In him was life; and the life was the light of men....

How plainly is pictured the position of those who think they have all the truth, who take pride in their knowledge of the word of God, while its sanctifying power has not been felt in their lives. The fervor of the love of God is wanting in their hearts, but it is this very fervor of love that makes God's people the light of the world. The True Witness says of a cold, lifeless, Christless church, “I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.” Mark the following words: “Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.” Here is represented a people who pride themselves in their possession of spiritual knowledge and advantages. But they have not responded to the unmerited blessings that God has bestowed upon them. They have been full of rebellion, ingratitude, and forgetfulness of God; and still he has dealt with them as a loving, forgiving father deals with an ungrateful, wayward son. They have resisted his grace, abused his privileges, slighted his opportunities, and have been satisfied to sink down in contentment, in lamentable ingratitude, hollow formalism, and hypocritical insincerity.

Those who labor in word and doctrine, must be men who search the Scriptures daily, who pray earnestly and constantly for divine enlightenment, If the ministers would individually hang their helpless souls upon Christ, there would be much more moisture in their discourses. Those who, to a large degree, give evidence of being dry and fruitless, should realize that the reason for this is found in the fact that they are not connected with Christ. They do not draw sap and nourishment from the living Vine. And Christ says, “Without me ye can do nothing.” Self has been woven in the labors of many but the true child of God will feel as did John the Baptist when he said, speaking of Christ, “He must increase, but I must decrease.”"},{"refcode_short":"1888 402.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

When He sees men lifting the burdens, trying to carry them in the lowliness of mind, with distrust of self, and with reliance upon Him, He adds to their work His perfection and sufficiency, and it is accepted of the Father. We are accepted in the Beloved. The sinner's defects are covered by the perfection and fullness of the Lord our righteousness.

He rolled away the thick darkness from the throne of God, the hellish shadow which Satan had cast to hide God from sight and from knowledge.

His clothing his divinity with humanity brings that love in clear evidence of light that humanity can comprehend it; that will indite the petition in the heart to pray as did Moses, “I beseech thee, show me thy glory.” Remember the ear of the Lord is open to our prayers. “Ask and it shall be given to you, seek and ye shall find.” “If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children,” how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him.” Then why not take God at his word? Why not believe with all the heart and mind and soul. Why not by faith take hold of the divine nature. It is our privilege. All things shall be done for him that believeth. I am so grateful this morning that I have a living Saviour. Praise God from whom all blessings flow! How can we dishonor God more decidedly than to distrust him? We must never be discouraged. We must be patient, kind, we must by faith be receiving that abundant supply as God is willing to bestow and wait by faith on the Lord believing he will do the things we ask him.

God help us is my prayer. We must rise higher and nearer to heaven in our aspirations. Seek things that are above. We must rise from the lowlands of earth to a higher power, lovelier light. We must love higher, and live higher. No Christian reaches the highest point of attainment that overloads himself with worries about this world or in carrying his pet sins along with him. We can and should breathe a purer atmosphere and taste more heavenly joys. We need Jesus every day and with his strength we may gain strength, yes grow in grace for heavier conflicts and obtain inspiring views of heavenly things.

God can teach you more in one moment by his Holy Spirit than you could learn from the great men of the earth. The universe is looking upon the controversy that is going on upon the earth. At an infinite cost, God has provided for every man an opportunity to know that which will make him wise unto salvation. How eagerly do angels look to see who will avail himself of this opportunity! When a message is presented to God's people, they should not rise up in opposition to it; they should go to the Bible, comparing it with the law and the testimony, and if it does not bear this test, it is not true. God wants our minds to expand. He desires to put his grace upon us. We may have a feast of good things every day; for God can open the whole treasure of heaven to us. We are to be one with Christ as he is one with the Father, and the Father will love us as he loves his Son. We may have the same help that Christ had, we may have strength for every emergency; for God will be our front guard and our rereward. He will shut us in on every side, and when we are brought before rulers, before the authorities of the earth, we need not meditate beforehand of what we shall say. God will teach us in the day of our need. Now may God help us to come to the feet of Jesus and learn of him, before we seek to become teachers of others."},{"refcode_short":"1888 536","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

When we do that, then we work the works of righteousness. But when God is calling the sinner in our world, and inviting him, there is no condition there; he is drawn by the invitation of Christ and it is not, “Now you have got to respond in order to come to God.” The sinner comes, and as he comes and views Christ elevated upon that cross of Calvary, which God impresses upon his mind, there is a love beyond anything that is imagined that he has taken hold of. And what then? As he beholds that love, why he says that he is a sinner. Well, then, what is sin? Why at once he has to come here to find out. There is no definition given in our world but that transgression is the transgression of the law; and therefore he finds out what sin is.

But no matter how high a position a man may hold, it is no reason that he should be looked upon as incapable of making mistakes. The Lord may have given him a work to do, but unless Christ abides with him continually, unless he abides in Christ without a moment's separation, he will make mistakes and fall into error. But if men do make mistakes and fall into error, it is no reason that we should withdraw our confidence from them; for God alone is infallible. We must have the truth abiding in our hearts; we must draw nigh to God continually; for we shall have the powers of darkness to meet just as long as time shall last. We shall have to battle with the enemy of our souls until the coming of the Lord. When Christ was upon the earth, he contended with the enemy for the salvation of men, and when he left the world, he committed the conflict to his followers, to be carried forward in his name; and we are to wage this war day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute. To every soul of us belongs the battle. We do not know what God has for us to do. If we have only one talent, we should put it out to the exchangers; for if we are faithful in that which is least, in the future we shall be made ruler over many things. We should bring glory to God, and not make ourselves a center, and God will make us fruitful branches. We must center in Christ, as the branch is in the vine, and then we shall be in a position to bless all who come within the sphere of our influence."},{"refcode_short":"1888 547.4","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

We do not half understand the preciousness of this lesson; we must learn more and more the significance of these words. We need our eyes anointed that we may see the light of truth. We must not think, “Well, we have all the truth, we understand the main pillars of our faith, and we may rest on this knowledge.” The truth is an advancing truth, and we must walk in the increasing light. A brother asked, “Sister White, do you think we must understand the truth for ourselves? Why can we not take the truths that others have gathered together, and believe them because they have investigated the subjects, and then we shall be free to go on without the taxing of the powers of the mind in the investigation of all these subjects? Do you not think that these men who have brought out the truth in the past were inspired of God?” I dare not say they were not led of God, for Christ leads into all truth; but when it comes to inspiration in the fullest sense of the word, I answer, No. I believe that God has given them a work to do, but if they are not fully consecrated to God at all times, they will weave self and their peculiar traits of character into what they are doing, and will put their mold upon the work, and fashion men in religious experience after their own pattern. It is dangerous for us to make flesh our arm. We should lean upon the arm of infinite power. God has been revealing this to us for years.

I can find that evidence if I search the Scriptures with constant prayer, and I can know that I do know what is truth.” You need not preach the truth as the product of another man's mind, you must make it your own. When the woman of Samaria was convinced that Jesus was the Messiah, she hastened to tell her neighbors and townsmen. She said, “Come, see a man which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.... And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did....

Our brethren should be willing to investigate in a candid way every point of controversy. If a brother is teaching error, those who are in responsible positions ought to know it; and if he is teaching truth, they ought to take their stand at his side. We should all know what is being taught among us, for if it is truth, we need to know it. The Sabbath-school teacher needs to know it, and every Sabbath-school scholar ought to understand it. We are all under obligation to God to know what he sends to us.

Do not catch at every objection, however small, and make it as large as possible, and preserve it for future use.

Provision has been made whereby God can love us as he loves his Son, and it is through our oneness with Christ and with each other. We must each come to the fountain and drink for ourselves. A thousand around us may take of the stream of salvation, but we shall not be refreshed unless we drink of the healing stream ourselves. We must see the beauty, the light of God's word for ourselves, and kindle our taper at the divine altar, that we may go to the world, holding forth the word of life as a bright, shining lamp.

He has cast his shadow between us and our Saviour, that we may not discern what Christ is to us, or what he may be. The enemy does not desire us to understand what a comfort we shall find in Christ. We have only just begun to get a little glimmering of what faith is; for it is hard for those who have been absorbed in looking at dark pictures of unbelief, to see anything else save darkness. May God help us to gather up the jewels of his promises, and deck memory's hall with the gems of his word. We should be armed with the promises of God. Our souls should be barricaded with them. When Satan comes in with his darkness, and seeks to fill my soul with gloom, I repeat some precious promise of God. When our work grows hard because of the unbelief we have to meet in the hearts of the people, where faith should flourish, I repeat over and over, “Although the fig-tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls: yet will I rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation.” As I do this, the light of the glory of God fills my soul.

And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.” This is what we are to do. We are on missionary soil, and we should pray that God may stir up the minds of those who do not seem to feel their need of anything more than they now possess, that they may seek for light from the throne of God. We should not be found quibbling, and putting up hooks on which to hang our doubts in regard to the light which God sends us. When a point of doctrine that you do not understand comes to your attention, go to God on your knees, that you may understand what is truth, and not be found, as were the Jews, fighting against God. Light came to them, but they loved darkness rather than light. When warning men to beware, to accept nothing unless it is truth, we should also warn them not to imperil their souls by rejecting messages of light, but to press out the darkness by earnest study of the word of God. Greater caution should be exercised by all, lest we reject that which is truth. We need a living experience. In faith we are only like little children learning to walk. As a child takes its first steps, it often totters and falls; but it gets up again, and finally learns that it can walk alone. We must learn how to believe in God. We are not to look at our feelings, but to know God by living faith. Look at the centurion who came to Christ for an example of genuine faith. He came to Christ beseeching him, and saying, “Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented. And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him. The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.

Every branch in me that beareth not fruit shall be taken away.” Now, here is something for us to study. “Taken away.” We have our opportunities now to bear fruit; we have our opportunities now that we can reveal that we are fruit-bearing branches of the vine. And if we go on now in a careless and indifferent manner, then what will be our position? He tells us He will take us away, for we cannot do anything without Christ; and if we are as a dead branch and do not draw any sap and nourishment from the living vine, we shall become withered branches. He says every branch that beareth fruit, He purgeth it (pruneth it), that it may bring forth more fruit. Then He tells them that “It is My Father's good pleasure that ye bring forth much fruit.” Are we the branches of the living vine? Now, if we are, we are distinct; we are not all blended together; there are a number of branches, but we have one parent stock.

Christ said, “Ye have ears, but ye hear not; ye have eyes but ye see not.” The prejudice, the self-esteem, the pride of heart which you now possess, unless it is removed by the spirit of God, will cause you to walk in the sparks of your own kindling, and lie down in sorrow. There can be no calamity greater that could come to our conferences, than for men to go to the different churches with such a blind zeal, and such a lofty self-sufficient spirit as some have carried through this meeting. Ourself being one of them, I tell you in the name of the Lord to search your own heart. Humble yourself under the mighty hand of God, else He will humble you. Seek the Lord; break your heart by falling on the Rock, Christ Jesus."},{"refcode_short":"1888 588.2","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

But to the contrite and penitent and humble He says, Lift thyself up; stand before Me; behold My face with comfort and assurance and with joy; be not afraid. He who would lift himself up in His presence must first prostrate himself at the foot of the cross of Calvary. Then can men be reconciled to God in Christ Jesus, and be clothed with Christ's righteousness. What is it to stand before the Lord? It means to desire His way above all things, that the will of the Lord many be at all time plainly manifested to us, and that we may do nothing from moment to moment but what shall please him and promote His glory. Self is put out of sight; we are to watch for any tokens from the Lord, listen attentively with our mind and heart to hear His voice, His directions and His reproofs and commands, that we may know the way of His commandments. This is walking with God, and this is standing before the Lord. Let self die in you; have humble ideas of yourself; you are not fit to be a teacher, unless you are daily a learner in the cause and works of the Master."},{"refcode_short":"1888 590","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

I can not tell you how hard the pressure was. It seemed to amount to an agony, and in the night season it was an agony. I did not know what to expect, or how long this thing was going to persevere. I stood before our people after I came from Minneapolis in the church. I told them what God had presented to me. I stood before them in this room, when the Committee was here. I told them that every one of them that laid that hardness into their hearts when they were at Minneapolis, and that pursued the course they did, they never would see a ray of light till they confessed it. It has not had any influence on Brother Smith, but he stood just as strong to push back. I have had to stand all the time to push, and when I have felt that I could not do it, then the words have come, “I am back of you to push with you.” And the light that came to me night before last laid it all open again before me, just the influence that was at work, and just where it would lead. I want to tell you, brethren, whoever you are, I want to tell you, that you are just going over the very same ground that they went over in the days of Christ. You have had their experience; But God deliver us from having the come-out of it as they had. But notwithstanding you have heard my testimony, notwithstanding it was the testimony of the Spirit of God, you have braced yourselves,—a few of you, strong men of determined will,—to carry it out on your line, to fight it out on your line. May God have mercy upon your souls, because you need it. You have stood right in the way of God. The earth is to be lighted with his glory, and if you stand where you stand today, you might just as quick say that the Spirit of God was the spirit of the devil. You have said it now in your actions, in your attitudes, that it is the spirit of the devil. You have said it thus, and you will say it when the crisis will come. And while praying here on my knees, I have had the evidence that there would be a break. The Spirit of God has come upon me, the light of heaven has shown into my heart, and his comforting grace is upon me. My mind is just as clear as a sunbeam; I rejoice in God my Saviour today. I thank God that I have not been discouraged to death; I thank God that I have clung to the arm of infinite power to stand all but alone. The ones that ought to have stood with me, that God would have to stand with me to receive the blessings, have stood to hedge up my way in every step. I want to tell you, brethren, there are debaters among us. I warned them in Minneapolis never to put a minister in a Conference by the side of a debater. For the last twenty years the light has shown upon me in regard to debaters. They will turn light into darkness. That is just what Brother [Matthew] Larson will do. He has an education, but unless the Holy Ghost shall come upon him, he will never go through with this cause to its close. What is the matter? I am afraid of Brother Larson; I am afraid of Brother Larson. I will not converse with you unless you are [with] other men. You will take my words. You will put a false interpretation upon them, and you will make them mean this or that other than they shall. And those that stand criticizing, let me tell you, you are walking in the sparks of your own kindling, and you are right down in darkness. It is the word of God. God presented the case before me. I told it to Brother Morrison when we were in Des Moines. Said I: “If you don't come out as Elder Canright, it is because you will be a converted man; but every soul that is connected with you that you have educated and trained as a debater, you will wish that work was undone.” Brethren, we are not here for this work. We are not here to study infidel authors, to open our minds to the suggestions of the devil. We are here to get ready for the judgment, and we are right on the borders of the eternal world. Here are many that are to go forth to their fields of labor to strengthen the things that are ready to die, or to be powers of darkness. Now what are you going to do in this matter?"},{"refcode_short":"1888 595.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

I hoped, Brother Porter, when you were at Kansas, and the Spirit of the Lord came upon you, I hoped you might be in the light; but you are not in the light. Do not be surprised if I, when you are in the darkness, refuse to have an interview with any of you. I have told you over and over again. Christ said: “Why do you not hear my words?” I would say, “Why do you not hear the words of Christ that are presented to you? Why will you have darkness? They are so afraid to see that there is another ray of light. They will build up every conceivable barrier against it. You are working just as the Jews were. Do not hang on to Brother Smith. In the name of God, I tell you, he is not in the light. He has not been in the light since he was at Minneapolis.

Brethren, pray. Don't argue, but pray before God, and let every soul hang himself upon God. Let us seek God now that we may find him. Let the truth of God come into your hearts; open the door. Now I tell you here before God, that the covenant question, as it has been presented, is the truth. It is the light. In clear lines it has been laid before me. And those that have been resisting the light, I ask you whether they have been working for God, or for the devil. It is the clear light of heaven, and it means much to us. It means to show us that you can not depend upon your own smartness and your criticisms, but you must hang your helpless soul upon Jesus Christ, and upon Him alone. God help you to see. God help you to understand. The angels of God will be round about us, if we will only cling to the right. Wherever Christ is, there are angels. Wherever Christ abides there are angels to communicate the power and the grace and the glory. I honor my Lord and my Master. I want to carry the banner of truth to the very close of this message. And when the message shall triumph, I want to triumph with it. No more will my lips be sealed. I have been watching to see what course these men would take, how much light would come into their souls. I have been watching to see. I told Brother Dan Jones, I will not tell you my opinion; my faith. Dig in the Bible. Sink the shaft of truth to find out what is truth. But I tell you today, while I have been keeping in silence, the Lord has been revealing night after night, the position of individual cases before me. The converting power of God is needed in our midst. He will work through our ministers as he did in Bethlehem. He will shed his light and his glory upon us if we will only give him a chance. But when you begin to talk with them they will make your words mean something else. The Devil is at their side. He is just as much at their side as he was at the side of those men of Nazareth when Christ proclaimed that he was the anointed one. The power of God, the Holy Ghost, the great Convictor, said it was so, and they said right out it was so. But the Devil said, Think of this; why, His mother and his brethren are right here with us. Well, then, Satan followed up the track, and what next? They were ready to pitch him over the precipice. It is not best to set the feet an inch in the powers of darkness. But God help us right here on this ground to surrender to Him. I have born testimony after testimony, but it has not had any weight. They have rejected everything but their own ideas. May God help you to not close your hearts and minds to this testimony. May God help you to accept and receive it as truth."},{"refcode_short":"1888 599","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

The most convincing testimony that we can bear to others that we have the truth is the spirit which attends the advocacy of that truth. If it sanctifies the heart of the receiver, if it makes him gentle, kind, forbearing, true and Christlike, then he will give some evidence of the fact that he has the genuine truth. But if he acts as did the Jews when their opinions and ideas were crossed, then we certainly cannot receive such testimony, for it does not produce the fruits of righteousness.

But why? They will take the testimony of somebody else, and they will all be credulous in regard to that. Now when it comes to the manifest movement of the Spirit of God, if the Spirit was in their hearts they would recognize it in a moment. But the trouble is, the Spirit is not in them. And they never will search these things to see if they are so. The reason why I felt so at Minneapolis was that I have seen that everyone that has taken a position similar to the one they took in Minneapolis would go into the darkest unbelief. Have we not seen it acted over and over again? Then when we see just how Christ was tried, when He came upon earth; when we see the hardness of the hearts; when we see what the enemy can do with human nature, putting unbelief into the heart, I should think it would be such a terror to our souls that we would not dare to open the heart to the miseries of unbelief and dwell in that atmosphere, such as there has been since we were in Minneapolis."},{"refcode_short":"1888 637.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

But they excuse it all. “Why, we did not know that some things were so and so.” When we get the Spirit of God in our hearts, He will speak to us. There is the trouble. When they see that God is working in a certain line, they commence with all the power of brain, and all the power of thought, and all the power of talk, as it has been the case here, to stay the work of God.

If it is a suggestion of unbelief, credence is given to that at once. You will never have greater light and evidence than you have had here; if you wait till the judgment, what you have had here will condemn you. But God has been speaking and His power has been in our midst, and if you have not evidences enough to show you where and how God is working, you never will have it. You will have to gather up the rays of light that you have had, and not question so. “But there are some things that are not explained.” Well, what if everything is not explained? Where is the weight of evidence? God will balance the mind if it is susceptible for the influence of the Spirit of God; if it is not, then it will decide on the other side.

Well, if they had only known that these objections that we have been fighting were no objections, then they would not have done it. Well, is that any excuse? Why did they not know?

Christ declares that Our Heavenly Father is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him, than earthly parents are to give good gifts to their children. The day of Pentecost furnished a wonderful occasion. In the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, what a testimony was given to the abundance of the grace of Christ. Why is it that those who claim to believe advanced truth, live so far beneath their privileges? Why do they mingle self with all they do? If they will cast out self, Jesus will pour into the thirsty soul a constant supply from the river of life. How can our ministers become the representatives of Christ, when they feel self-sufficient—when by spirit and attitude they say, “I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing”?

Were there no justice, no penalty, there would be no stability to the government of God. It is the mingling of judgment and mercy that makes salvation full and complete. It is the blending of the two that leads us, as we view the world's Redeemer, and the law of Jehovah, to exclaim, “Thy gentleness hath made me great.” We know that the gospel is a perfect and complete system, revealing the immutability of the law of God. It inspires the heart with hope, and with love for God. Mercy invites us to enter through the gates into the city of God, and justice is satisfied to accord to every obedient soul full privileges as a member of the royal family, a child of the heavenly King. If we were defective in character, we could not pass the gates that mercy has opened to the obedient; for justice stands at the entrance, and demands holiness, purity, in all who would see God. Were justice extinct, and were it possible for divine mercy to open the gates to the whole race, irrespective of character, there would be a worse condition of disaffection and rebellion in heaven than before Satan was expelled. The peace, happiness, and harmony of heaven would be broken up.

The habits, the conversation, the daily life must be wholly consecrated on the Lord's side, and they must hold communion with God. He must be their divine Counselor, and there must be by the church as a whole and by its individual members a spirit of intercession and wrestling with our covenant-keeping God in behalf of themselves and also for the watchmen on the walls of Zion and the workers in the cause of God, that they may be clothed with the garments of salvation and may have at this time power to prevail with God, that many souls may be the fruits of their ministry.

John calls upon the world to “behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God.” It is a love that passeth knowledge.

Pride of heart prevented his hearers from humbling themselves before God, and confessing their sin in resisting his Holy Spirit, and reluctantly it left them. On the crest of Olivet, as he beheld the city, he wept over it, saving, “If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace!” Here he paused; he was loth to utter the irrevocable sentence. O that Jerusalem would repent! When the fast westering sun should pass out of sight, her day of mercy would be ended. Jesus closed his sentence, “But now they are hid from thine eyes.” On another occasion he lamented the impenitence of the chosen city: “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate” The Lord forbid that this scene should now be repeated in the experience of God's professed people! “My Spirit,” he says, “shall not always strive with man.” The time will come when it must be said of the impenitent, “Ephraim is joined to his idols; let him alone.”"},{"refcode_short":"1888 764.13","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

When the members of the church humble themselves before God by zealous, not half-hearted, lifeless action, the Lord will receive them. But he declares, “I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.” How long shall this warning be resisted? How long shall it be slighted?"},{"refcode_short":"1888 765.2","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Spirituality deadened, humility and childlike simplicity gone, a mechanical, formal profession of faith has taken the place of love and devotion. Is this mournful condition of things to continue? is the lamp of God's love to go out in darkness? The Saviour calls; listen to his voice: “Be zealous and repent.” Repent, confess your sins, and you will be forgiven. “Turn ye, turn ye; for why will ye die?” Why will you try to rekindle a mere fitful fire, and walk in the sparks of your own kindling?"},{"refcode_short":"1888 765.4","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Solemn thought for our churches! solemn, indeed, for every individual! Marvelous is the patience and forbearance of God; but “except thou repent,” it will be exhausted; the churches, our institutions, will go from weakness to weakness, from cold formality to deadness, while they are saying, “I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing.” The True Witness says, “And knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.” Will they ever see clearly their true condition?"},{"refcode_short":"1888 765.5","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

In the manifestation of that power which lightens the earth with the glory of God, they will see only something which in their blindness they think dangerous, something which will arouse their fears, and they will brace themselves to resist it. Because the Lord does not work according to their ideas and expectations, they will oppose the work. “Why,” they say, “should not we know the Spirit of God, when we have been in the work so many years?—Because they did not respond to the warnings, the entreaties of the messages of God, but persistently said, “I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing.” Talent, long experience, will not make men channels of light, unless they place themselves under the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness, and are called, and chosen, and prepared by the endowment of the Holy Spirit. When men who handle sacred things will humble themselves under the mighty hand of God, the Lord will lift them up. He will make them men of discernment—men rich in the grace of his Spirit. Their strong, selfish traits of character, their stubbornness, will be seen in the light shining from the Light of the world. “I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.” If you seek the Lord with all your heart, he will be found of you."},{"refcode_short":"1888 765.6","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

The instrumentalities to be used are those souls who gladly receive the light of truth which God communicates to them. These are God's agencies for communicating the knowledge of truth to the world. If through the grace of Christ his people will become new bottles, he will fill them with the new wine. God will give additional light, and old truths will be recovered, and replaced in the frame-work of truth; and wherever the laborers go, they will triumph.

Can you afford to let this matter stand as it is, and you come up to the judgment with the actions that were performed against him in every particular to confront you? Prof. Bell was not a perfect man; he made mistakes and committed errors, but these errors were far less in the sight of God than the errors you have both made in the course you have pursued toward him. He deserved no such treatment from your hands. In bruising him you bruised your own souls. Your course was not at all after Christ's directions; you were led by another spirit; you walked in the light of the sparks of your own kindling and weakened your own souls. You will have to do your work thoroughly else you will have to meet the same to answer for at the bar of God. Just as you have dealt with Prof. Bell, will the Lord deal with you unless you repent and confess your errors, and enlist your Advocate in heaven to plead your case. The spirit of the meekness and gentleness of Christ would have led you in an entirely different course had you followed the directions that Christ has given you in his word; you would have stood in an entirely different position today. “So speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but be gentle, showing all meekness unto all men.” For we ourselves were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived.” But if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness, considering, thyself lest thou also be tempted. Have you obeyed the words of Christ. If you have done things in that matter that are wrong you will not have those wrongs cancelled unless you confess them, and make restitution where you have injured your brother. I know, for the Lord opened the matter to me, that you had both acted as if you had lost all your feelings of sympathy and love out of your heart, and in wounding him as you did, you wounded Jesus Christ in the person of his saints. You will never be free men until you confess your faults and be reconciled to your brother. It is a most dangerous way to treat your own souls to allow yourselves to do the wrongs which the Lord reproved in you, and yet you pass along as if you were just, and obeying the words of God. Will you look at this matter as it is and make clean work for eternity? I was shown that a grievous wrong was done. I am sorry that you are affected with defective spiritual eye-sight. I beg of you for your soul's sake to buy of the heavenly merchant man gold that ye may be rich; white raiment that ye may be clothed, and anoint thine eyes with eye-salve that thou mayest see. It is the only safe way for you to do when you err, to confess your faults thoroughly, and repent of them sincerely, and then pray one for another that ye may be healed."},{"refcode_short":"1888 792.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Clear the king's highway, remove the stumbling blocks out of the path, dare not to do a surface work here, for others have looked to you and followed your example far more than they have looked to God and sought his counsel.

You have had evidence and might have had a much larger array of evidence if you had any room to receive it. Jesus, the precious Saviour, has again and again sent you the very light you needed, but you did not place yourself in the channel where it could be communicated to you. You gathered about your soul the covering of unbelief till you cannot distinguish light from darkness and error from truth. Never, never will you change this order of things until you possess the humility of a little child. This will never be until you fall upon the rock and are broken. Self then dies; new habits are to be formed; strong inclinations and propensities are overcome. Enemies within and without are ready to spring into life and overcome you. “Without me” said Christ, “ye can do nothing.” Do you decline the contest? Do you refuse to fall on the rock? If so, there is not the slightest assurance in your case that you will ever recover yourself out of the snare of the devil. Your attitude has encouraged a state of things in our churches which you have not measured. The result of your course and your working on the same line since you left Minneapolis has made the carrying out of the work given me of God to do fifty fold harder than it need to have been. You have barred my way, but O, how little did you know the real result of your work. This has been opened before me. When you have stated that Sr. White was influenced by W. C. W., A. T. Jones, and E. J. Waggoner, in hearts infidelity that has been nourished and has borne fruit. You will not be pleased to reap the harvest. Satan takes everything of this character and makes it a living active agent in destroying faith in the very work the Lord would have them to do. Every soul that fully takes your words and believes them are correctly represented by the words of Christ, “I would that thou were either cold or hot, so then because that thou art lukewarm, I will spew thee out of my mouth.” Decided opposition would have done me less harm. A faith in the messages God has given me to bear of the order represented is decided unbelief to all intents and purposes. There is not one bit of savor in such a faith, and the faith of Elder Butler is of the same order, valueless, having no savor, I count nothing upon you or him to harmonize with me in my work given me of God. Your very position is a decided negative to the efforts I may make as God shall move upon me by his holy Spirit. I have not felt grieved as far as my personal self is concerned, but when the work that the Lord has given me is of such a character that faith needs to be constantly cherished because of the warnings, reproofs and searchings of the hearts, and the laying bare of hidden sins is not pleasant and agreeable to the natural heart, and many give a bare assent to truth when they are not sanctified through the truth. They do not in Spirit represent Christ. They are surface workers, and delude themselves with the idea that they are christians. So effectually does this delusion take possession of heart and mind that the sharp arrows of the Lord fail to penetrate the armor of self righteousness in which they are encased. The spell is so strong that they will listen to the truth, the most earnest and powerful, even to the very portraying of the delusions which are upon them without any thought of self-examination to see if it means them. This is the class our Saviour found most difficult to arouse. The most authoritative teachings were heard and listened to as if they heard not. Thus it is with many, many in this generation. There will be a hatred kindled against the testimonies which is satanic. The workings of Satan will be to unsettle the faith of the churches in them for this reason: Satan cannot have so clear a track to bring in his deceptions and bind up souls in his delusions if the warnings and reproofs and counsels of the spirit of God are heeded. What better course to please the enemy and grieve the spirit of God could be pursued than that which has been pursued by you, my brother, a teacher in Israel. You have had quite a number fully engaged with you in the work, men in responsible positions, presidents of conferences, ministers and workers, that have formed a confederacy to question, to criticize, to say, “Report and we will report it.” The position these men have occupied and the influence this position had given them has caused many to doubt, who will never be settled again and the deceptions and delusions of these last days will overcome them, because heaven's divine illumination is powerless to set them in order for they have decided from the example given them. It makes no difference whether they believe or disbelieve, so if any reproof comes to them, which they wish not to believe, they will say, “O, Sr. White is influenced. Some one has told her these things. If Elder Smith who knows all about the testimonies says this is only her own opinion and her own judgment, and he does not accept the teachings of the testimonies, and he such a good man, I will follow his example and I will risk it.” This is a very unwise thing to do, yet many are doing this and have done it. I know that the spirit of the Lord was holding me here in Battle Creek that all might have my evidence whether it was of God or of the Devil. “By their fruits ye shall know them.” As in the days of Christ some have overlooked the very evidence God has given them and have said show us a sign, work some miracle if you are right."},{"refcode_short":"1888 798.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

What doest thou work?” The same words merely have been said to me since the Minneapolis meeting. I have as a little child in all simplicity talked freely with any one who wished to ask any question. I have been willing to tell them and show them all things that my heavenly father hath revealed to me. I have thought these things must make them see and believe, and now I am inclined to think that my earnest efforts to have them see and understand has worked in a different way from what I had hoped. I think they have not regarded my words or understood my motives and the more I have done in this line the less influence has my testimony had upon them, and now I feel no inclination to converse with the men who occupy responsible positions. I feel like one who knows that they have been watched. Their words misconstrued, their advise and counsel treated as a common affair, and unworthy of special notice. I have again had repeated to me “Spiritual things are spiritually discerned.” I hang my helpless soul on Jesus Christ. I have no desire now to produce one particle of evidence to any one. Those who want to see can open their eyes and see. “Ye shall know them by their fruits” The judgment now that any one will pass upon me or my words, or my works will not surprise me. I expect anything and lean on no one, depend on no one. My work will not be hence forth to make any one believe but go forward, out of the atmosphere of unbelief and caviling and criticism. I have more freedom speaking to unbelievers than to those who hold responsible positions, and who have had so great light and great opportunities and have not responded to the light.

I would, if I had dared given up this field of conflict long ago, but something has held me. But I will not choose my way or my will. In the life of Christ in the time of his greatest trial, one of his disciples betrayed and another thrice denied him, and all forsook him and fled. If the Master who was without the taint of sin endured this, then shall I expect any better portion? O, how many tried to find witness against Christ.

It seemed that a tidal wave of the glory of the Lord swept over the congregation, and many, many souls were filled with a rich blessing of God, and this occasion to them was one never to be forgotten. They bore testimony that the power of God thrilled through and through them. Some persons were as pale as death, but their countenances were shining with the glory of God. This church had been newly raised up, and was in need of encouragement. O, Bless the Lord, bless the Lord; O, my soul! for the great goodness and mercy of God! One brother in a prominent position in the Chicago mission had been so weighted down with discouragement that we all feared that he would separate from the work, but he was present at the meeting and was greatly blessed. He said that he came to that meeting, heavy in heart and under a dark cloud, but the Lord Jesus met him while bowed in prayer. We had called them forward; but he did not come; but the Lord met him. “I seemed to have the Lord Jesus close beside me,” he said. “How lovely, how precious, I thought I could touch him. I knew Jesus was by my side.” And then he broke out in a description of Christ as seen by the eye of faith. He was a man very reticent, but of few words, but his tongue was loosed, his language was eloquent, as he expressed the attributes of Christ as he was revealed to him. Said he, “I am as light as a feather, I am happy in God, and I want to get back to Chicago and tell them what the Lord has wrought for me.” Others bore testimony of the power of the Holy Spirit that came upon them."},{"refcode_short":"1888 856.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Praise the Lord for this! He has made humble acknowledgements, and the Lord will surely manifest himself to Eld. Smith. O, I am so glad that Satan's power is broken here in Battle Creek. I tell you there has been a resistance of my testimony. By some men of influence, such as Eld. Smith, there has been a counteracting of the messages that God has given to me for his people. The Lord is at work, and I pray that it may not cease till it shall be perfected in righteousness. I tell you the Lord is not asleep; he knows the conflicts of his people.

The cross of Christ must occupy the central place, Christ be lifted up as never before, and the attention of the people be riveted upon the world's Redeemer. We know comparatively little of the glory that attends the truth. O, we have so little faith! Jesus came to be the center of the recovered world. Says Christ, “I will implant the holy Spirit in every heart that will open to me; I will be a living, abiding power in every element of influence, and engage every holy agency in the universe.

White 1888 Materials, p. 857.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"We must possess the missionary spirit in a large degree. In his lessons to his disciples, Christ was constantly teaching them that they must unite the human agency with the divine worker. They are to be active in doing good; they are to be the light of the world, catching the radiance of light from his throne and to transmit it to the world which Satan has enshrouded with his Hellish shadow like a funeral pall. Not only are the rays of light to shine in the home circle but to the church in bright and distant rays; and again, not to the church only, but the whole world. See how much is contained in the prayer of Christ in the 17th Chapter of John, constantly identifying himself and combining himself with his believing people, and his believing people binding up with himself for the work of the salvation of a lost world. In his ministry he shows them the confederacy of evil arrayed against them, and reveals to them that they are in war-fare with principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness in high places. But angels unite to compose that army; they are mingling in their ranks. The Captain of the Lord's host is advancing with his army of heavenly angels to the work. Jesus is standing but a step, as it were, from the completion of his great sacrifice for the world. “Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to all creatures. He repeats his injunction over and over again in different forms, that they might after his death and resurrection to heaven, take in the significance of his words. After his resurrection, “then opened he their understanding that they might under stand the Scriptures, and said unto them, Thus it is written and thus it behoved Christ to suffer and to rise again the third day,” and that remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. “Ye shall receive power from on high after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth.” He knew that peculiar trials would assail them and he declares, “All power is mine.” He assured them that they must go out under the shield of omnipotence. “Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the world.” “Go” was his last word spoken to his disciples and this was the last indication of his will while he was upon the earth. His first act in heaven corresponded with his expressed will on the earth. His holy spirit was sent to them in rich abundance. The heavenly endowment was given. We know the apostles commenced their work in Jerusalem; three thousand were converted in a day. May the Lord arouse his people to action is my prayer. There is need for every individual member of the church to arouse to work for Jesus. The calls are coming in from every clime, “Come over and help us.” “The Spirit and the Bride say Come, and let him that is athirst come, and whosoever will, let him come and take of the waters of life freely.” There is our work laid out in a comprehensive manner for the diffusion of the truth. Jesus opened the fountain of life in the midst of the world and every soul who knoweth the Father and the Son are to be laborers together with God and to repeat the words in fullness and power, “Come.” All are to stop their fretting with one another, all are to combine their living, sanctified influence, and with one voice, say “Come, send the word along.” Come all along the lines, a chain of living voices united with determined effort ring around the globe, and the whole church is to awake from the death like slumber and say, “Come”, and to act in character the invitation they make, “Come.”"},{"refcode_short":"1888 859.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

If they were properly circulated, I have been shown it would prevent many from uniting in a petition to Congress to make Sunday observance a law.

Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.” The blessing comes because of pardon; pardon comes through faith that the sin, confessed and repented of, is borne by the great Sin-bearer. Thus from Christ cometh all our blessings. His death is an atoning sacrifice for our sins. He is the great Medium through whom we receive the mercy and favor of God. He, then, is indeed the Originator, the Author, as well as the Finisher, of our faith.—Manuscript 21, 1891, pp. 1-11.

I was shown that those who advocated these sentiments were not following the counsel of God, but were bringing in that which would surely lead souls away from safe ground, away from the third angel's message, into wrong paths, to a careless disregard of the injunctions of God, thus imperilling their own souls and the souls of others."},{"refcode_short":"1888 900.2","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Am I drawing nearer to God?” The Scripture says, “The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned.” If your hearts are not fully surrendered to God, if you do not submit your will to his, you will devise and plan without the guidance of Him who is mighty in counsel.

There is distrust, selfishness, and suspicion. A few hold fast their profession of faith. Others have been leaving the simplicity of the faith, and as the result they are now treading on the border-land of skepticism. They are spiritually beclouded; and thus many are holding serious errors. Some sit in judgment on the Scriptures, declaring that this or that passage is not inspired, because it does not strike their minds favorably. They cannot harmonize it with their ideas of philosophy and science, “falsely so called.” Others for different reasons question portions of the word of God. Thus many walk blindly where the enemy prepares the way. Now, it is not the province of any man to pronounce sentence upon the Scriptures, to judge or condemn any portion of God's word. When one presumes to do this, Satan will create an atmosphere for him to breathe which will dwarf spiritual growth. When a man feels so very wise that he dares to dissect God's word, his wisdom is, with God, counted foolishness. When he knows more, he will feel that he has everything to learn.

He saw the stones in the hands of those who had brought a false report, but this did not deter him; he had a message, and he would bear it. The same spirit will be manifested today by those who are true to God. The psalmist says, “They have made void thy law. Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.” When men press close to the side of Jesus, when Christ is abiding in their hearts by faith, their love for the commandments of God grows stronger in proportion to the contempt which the world heaps upon his holy precepts. It is at this time that the true Sabbath must be brought before the people by both pen and voice.

The mighty men and the lords of the kingdom were assembled, and they ate and drank, and had a jovial time, but the True Witness was there, and their profanity was recorded in the books of heaven. In the midst of their revelry, a bloodless hand appeared, tracing mysterious characters upon the wall of the palace, and their godless mirth was checked, and terror and despair took its place. They inquired for some one who could interpret the writing, and Daniel, the prophet of God, was called to the banquet room, and the servant of the Lord was able to decipher the writing, and interpret the meaning of the words. “This is the interpretation of the thing; Mene; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it Tekel; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.

Are the ministers of the Lord eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the Son of God? Jesus says, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.... It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.” My heart is drawn out to the hungry flock in Michigan, and you who have not fed on the living Bread, who have not drank of the healing streams of salvation, and do not know where to lead the flock of God that they may find refreshment, for Christ's sake, do not try to minister in the sacred desk, until you have an experience in the things of God.

The minister is to reveal Christ, not to exhibit himself to the people. Youth is not to be urged as an excuse for lightness and trifling; for the apostle exhorts that young men be sober-minded, and remember that they are to render an account to God for the influence they exert. Young men, if you have had no special sense of sin, if you are possessed of a spirit of trifling, do not seek to minister in the sacred desk, and jeopardize your own soul and the souls of others, and leave the impression on the world that you are representatives of the solemn truth for this time. Unless Jesus is formed within, the hope of glory, you will be a curse and not a blessing to the congregation, for the minister cannot bring the people to a higher standard than that which he himself reaches. But those who sincerely repent and turn to the Lord, will find in him a personal Saviour. He is able to save to the uttermost all that come unto God by him. He will save you from yourself, from every defilement, from all your foolishness. You are to believe in him, to “trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.” When you love Jesus, you will not grieve him by indulging sin in yourself; for you will realize that he came not to save you in your sins, but from your sins.

What can we think of churches that will listen to the testimony of men who have no power in prayer, no fervency in their devotion, no freedom in personal labor for souls? The Lord has commanded, “Be ye holy in all manner of conversation.” “Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them; for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.” The proof of the minister's call to preach the gospel is seen in his example and work. God desires men in the ministry who will esteem highly the things which he esteems, and preserve the sanctity of truth, and not do as did Nadab and Abihu. They discerned not the difference between the sacred and the common. Their senses were blunted with indulgence in wine, and they offered strange fire before the Lord. They did not realize the sacredness of the work in which they were engaged.

The Christian has access to divine power that is measureless, and it only waits his command to be used in the service of heaven. But though he has access to divine power, he is willing to be last of all. The cry of the lowly, contrite heart, is always heard by the Lord, and no obstacles in earth or hell can interpose between such a soul and God. O that we might see and understand this. Men feeble in mental qualifications, lowly in social position, through the grace of Christ have been wonderfully successful in winning souls to Christ. The secret of their success was that they reached men through their faith and confidence in God. They learned daily of him who is wonderful in counsel, and mighty in working. In the power of his grace they were laborers together with God. The life and experience of these men who relied not on men but on God, was like a tree planted by the river side, whose leaf will not wither, but be always green and his fruit will appear."},{"refcode_short":"1888 974.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

We must battle constantly in order to fight the good fight of faith. We can keep our souls in patient trust only as we put on Christ. A general faith is not enough. We must put on the robe of Christ's righteousness and wear it openly, bravely, decidedly, exhibiting Christ, and not expect too much of finite man, but keep looking unto Jesus, and become ravished with the perfections of his character.

I hope there will never be the slightest encouragement given to our people to put such wonderful confidence in finite, erring man as has been placed in Elder Butler, for ministers are not as God, and too much reliance has been placed upon Elder Butler in the past. Even the messages and testimonies were made of none effect through the influence of the words and ideas of Elder Butler. This sin has not been repented of by some of our people, and they will have to go over the ground again and again unless they cease from man, and put their whole trust in the living God. The mould which has been given to the work through the influence of Elder Butler has caused the labor of many toilsome years that it might be effaced. It is because men have been encouraged to look to one man to think for them, to be conscience for them, that they are now so inefficient, and unable to stand at their post of duty as faithful sentinels for God, allowing no one to interfere in matters pertaining to their relation to God. Let men seek not to men, but to God for wisdom. As a people we are not what we should be because we have depended upon the wisdom of mortals, and have not made God our dependence and trust.

This was the spirit cherished among us forty years ago. We would come together burdened in soul, praying that we might be one in faith and doctrine; for we knew that Christ is not divided. One point at a time was made the subject of investigation. Solemnity characterized these councils of investigation. The Scriptures were opened with a sense of awe. Often we fasted, that we might be better fitted to understand the truth. After earnest prayer, if any point was not understood, it was discussed, and each one expressed his opinion freely; then we would again bow in prayer, and earnest supplications went up to heaven that God would help us to see eye to eye, that we might be one, as Christ and the Father are one. Many tears were shed. If one brother rebuked another for his dullness of comprehension in not understanding a passage as he understood it, the one rebuked would afterward take his brother by the hand, and say, “Let us not grieve the Holy Spirit of God. Jesus is with us; let us keep a humble and teachable spirit;” and the brother addressed would say, “Forgive me, brother, I have done you an injustice.” Then we would bow down in another season of prayer. We spent many hours in this way. We did not generally study together more than four hours at a time, yet sometimes the entire night was spent in solemn investigation of the Scriptures, that we might understand the truth for our time. On some occasions the Spirit of God would come upon me, and difficult portions were made clear through God's appointed way, and then there was perfect harmony. We were all of one mind and one spirit."},{"refcode_short":"1888 991.5","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

We tried to make our differences as slight as possible by not dwelling on points that were of minor importance, upon which there were varying opinions. But the burden of every soul was to bring about a condition among the brethren which would answer the prayer of Christ that his disciples might be one as he and the Father are one. Sometimes one or two of the brethren would stubbornly set themselves against the view presented, and would act out the natural feelings of the heart; but when this disposition appeared, we suspended our investigations and adjourned our meeting, that each one might have an opportunity to go to God in prayer, and without conversation with others, study the point of difference, asking light from heaven. With expressions of friendliness we parted, to meet again as soon as possible for further investigation. At times the power of God came upon us in a marked manner, and when clear light revealed the points of truth, we would weep and rejoice together.

The apostle says, “Ye are not your own. For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.” When our schemes and our plans have been broken; when men who have depended upon our judgment conclude the Lord would lead them to act and judge for themselves, we should not feel like censuring, and like exercising arbitrary authority to compel them to receive our ideas. Those who are placed in authority should constantly cultivate self-control. I am thankful that God is a wise ruler, and every one who is a true disciple of Christ will be humble, lift his cross, and meekly follow where the self-denying, self-sacrificing Jesus leads the way. Disappointment may prove to be the greatest of blessings to us. We must learn that others have rights as well as we have, and when any of our brethren receive new light upon the Scriptures, he should frankly explain his position, and every minister should search the Scriptures with the spirit of candor to see if the points presented on a new subject can be substantiated by the inspired word. “The servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient; in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth.” Every soul must look to God with contrition and humility, that God may guide and lead and bless. We must not trust to others to search the Scriptures for us. Some of our leading brethren have frequently taken positions on the wrong side, and if God would send a message and wait for these older brethren to open the way for its advance, it would never reach the people. These brethren will be found in this position until they become partakers of the divine nature to a greater extent than ever they have been in the past. There is sadness in heaven over the spiritual blindness of many of our brethren. Our younger ministers who fill less important positions must make decided efforts to come to the light, to sink the shaft deeper and still deeper into the mine of truth."},{"refcode_short":"1888 992.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Those who would preserve their allegiance to God, who are active in his service, become the mark of every shaft and weapon of hell. If those who have had great light have not corresponding faith and obedience they soon become leavened with the prevailing apostasy; another spirit controls them.

Truth that has lost its power upon those who have long slighted its precious teaching, appears beautiful and attractive to those who are ready to walk in the light. The Spirit sets home the truth in such a manner as to arouse the conscience to discern and acknowledge the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom he has sent. Men see themselves as transgressors of the law of God. By faith they behold the infinite love of God in the gift of Jesus to our world. By faith they see the sentence of condemnation erased, and their names recorded in the book of life. They see the robe of Christ's righteousness presented to them, preparing them for the mansions above, that they may stand spotless before the Father.

The crisis is just before us, and the peril of those who were united in confederacy to resist the appeals of the Spirit of God at Minneapolis, that they would be in darkness until they should see where they had grieved the Spirit of God, and confessed their wrongs, and put up the bar, so that they would not go over the same ground again. Now I have received letters stating that a proposition has been made by the Health Retreat for Bro. Morrison to come to St. Helena to be superintendent there. Since writing the things which I felt urged by the Spirit of the Lord to write, I must caution you not to encourage Bro. Morrison of Iowa to take any position in the Health Retreat. He has not cleared himself from the part he acted at Minneapolis. Blindness of mind is upon him. We want no more bodies of death to leaven that poor, unfortunate Sanitarium. What kind of confidence can we have to do this, in the light God has given? No, I cannot see one ray of light in Morrison's connecting with the Retreat. There is needed there a man true as steel, who should be in principle firm as a rock, who will stand in defence of what he knows as right and truth. Suppose this element from Iowa is introduced into California, where is there reserved power to operate on the mind and heart? Years have passed, and the testimonies have been speaking decidedly to them. He has attended our conferences at Battle Creek, and yet what stand has he taken? He has not confessed his sin in resisting the Spirit of God at Minneapolis. If he is not converted, Satan will find him a ready agent to work against truth [and] righteousness. Elder Healey and several others are ready to join hands with him. Let us not move blindly. Let us not plan unless we have God to plan with us. Elder Olsen speaks of LeRoy Nicola as a good one to help him; he will be if he has made crooked things straight; but these men have done so much harm in their blindness, working against the messengers and messages God has sent, that I fear it would be a great mistake to reward them by giving them positions of trust as true men to be depended upon. It would reveal a lack of wisdom in those who ought to reason from cause to effect. Let him stay where he is, where his position is well known, and where his influence cannot be misunderstood, and where those who confederate with him will not do it ignorantly but understanding just what it means.

Though they could not convict him of sin, though they could not fail to see their own hypocrisy, they hated the Prince of life because he laid bare their evil ways.

He could see Jerusalem as she might have been,—holiness unto the Lord. For ages Judah had been the repository of sacred truth. Here the knowledge of Jehovah had been cherished and preserved, when God had not been acknowledged among the nations, and his worship was lost in the earth. The streets of Jerusalem had been trodden by angel feet, and its very soil had been sacred to God. From its temple prayer and praise had ascended to God. From its altar the bleeding sacrifice had testified to human guilt, pointing to the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world. The Lord had sent them messages of warning and reproof, of consolation and promise, by his prophets, rising up early and sending them, but they had beaten one and stoned another, and it could not be that a prophet should perish outside of Jerusalem. Finally God had sent his Son, and from the highest bough to the lowest he had searched for fruit, and had found none. For their sakes he had clothed his divinity with humanity, made himself of no reputation, fled before the feet of his accusers and haters, and yet carried a rebellious people upon his heart. He had done all that could be done, but they turned from him, demanding still more evidence. His life was one continual miracle, but they knew it not, and demanded that he should show them a miracle. But in the face of their utter rejection of his love, their unbelief in his mission and divinity, when he knew that the representative men of the nation were plotting for his destruction, he wept over the city of his love. His prophetic eye read the history of the past, and the woe and the guilt of the future, and his heart was breaking with agony because the people of God knew not the time of their visitation. Hell moved by a power from beneath, that the guilty inhabitants of Jerusalem might carry out the will of the prince of darkness. Stirred with enmity they would yield themselves to the control of the malignant foe, and make the Prince of life their victim. Clouds of wrath were gathering over the doomed city; for they called down upon themselves judgment, crying, “His blood be on us and upon our children.” That blood by virtue of which the repentant sinner might be forgiven—that blood by which a guilty world might be saved, by which the Jewish nation might be saved and purified, which was paid a ransom for the sins of the world, was to them the final guilt in the cup of their iniquity. Jesus knew that his chosen people were to put him, the Prince of life and glory, to an ignominious death. He knew what was to be their doom. With prophetic glance he saw the Roman legions, he heard the tramp of armies, saw the city encompassed and in flames, and the temple a smoking ruin. The miseries of the people whom he longed to save, rose up before him.

He had passed through the terrible scenes when there was war in heaven, when Satan had been expelled from the abode of bliss, and before his vision were all the consequences of sin. O if he could but do one act of mercy by which they might be led to abandon their rebellion, and come to him that he might save; but he had exhausted the resources of infinite love.

The light of heaven penetrated the darkened minds of those who had been deceived by the enemies of Christ, and the false representation of him was rejected; for through the efficiency of the holy Spirit they now saw him exalted to be a prince and Saviour, to give repentance unto Israel, and remission of sins. They saw him encircled with the glory of heaven, with infinite treasures in his hands to bestow upon those who turn from their rebellion. As the apostles set forth the glory of the only begotten of the Father, 3,000 souls were pricked to the heart, and they were made to see themselves as they were sinful and polluted, and Christ as their Saviour and Redeemer. Christ was lifted up, Christ was glorified, through the power of the holy Spirit resting upon men. By the eye of faith these believers saw him as the one who had borne humiliation, suffering, and death, that they might not perish, but have everlasting life. As they looked upon his spotless righteousness, they saw their own deformity and pollution, and were filled with godly fear, with love and adoration for Him who gave his life a sacrifice for them.

The Saviour of men will be glorified, and the earth will be lightened with the bright shining of the beams of his righteousness.

Only believe in Jesus and learn in the school of the greatest Teacher the world ever knew, and His grace will act mightily upon the human intellect and heart. His teaching will give clearness to the mental vision. It will give compass to the thoughts; the soul hunger will be filled. The heart will be softened and subdued, and filled with glowing love that neither discouragement, despondency, affliction, or trial can quench. God will open to the mind's eye His preciousness and His fullness. Then let us love and labor. I point you to Christ, the Rock of ages. You can be saved only through Him.

He who blesses the habitation of the righteous says, “I know him that he will command.” There is no betraying of sacred trusts, no hesitating between right and wrong. The Holy One has given rules for the guidance of all,—the standard of character from which none can swerve and be guiltless. God's will is to be diligently and conscientiously studied, and it must be made paramount in all the affairs of life. The laws which every human agent is to obey flow from the heart of infinite love."},{"refcode_short":"1888 1113.2","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

The Sunday after the camp-meeting we had an appointment for Hastings, a town fourteen miles from Napier. Hastings, a small town, is situated in one of the best farming districts of New Zealand. Hastings is a little inland, and is more sheltered from the sea breezes than Napier is. When camp-meeting was first proposed for New Zealand, they thought Hastings the place, but finally decided to have it as Napier because more of our people live there. The ride from Napier to Hastings was very pleasant, the road was as level as the floor, so to speak, and several miles of it near the sea side. I spoke in the theatre to a good congregation who listened with deepest interest. This discourse was well received.

Four years ago there was an effort made by Elder Robert Hare in Palmerston, and the people turned out in a wonderful manner to hear. If right plans had been made there might have been many souls brought to the truth. Brother Hare was not working in the right lines, his main purpose was to get the largest kind of a congregation by fanciful preaching, which differed vastly from the preaching of John the fore runner of Christ. Many signed the covenant, but when he left it was demonstrated that they believed in Robert Hare, were attracted to the man and not to Jesus Christ. Many who signed the covenant were unconverted, and when left alone they withdrew their names. But in the last four years the population has double and another effort must be made and a meeting house built.

The Lord moved upon me to bear a decided testimony in reference to the office; but it was felt not to be appropriate. But this writing is before me and has been read to no less than thirty. I shall have it copied that you may see, and others may see how much such testimonies were effective to cure existing evils. There was with those put in trust the grave responsibilities of managing the office, a feeling of self-sufficiency, self-confidence because of inexperience in sacred things. They thought they were too wise to be taught, and too secure to need caution, and if no one makes shipwreck of faith and a good conscience, I shall be surprised. Mistakes I saw would be made, and the men who are handling sacred things were not inclined to be controlled. Were they confidently relying upon the wisdom from above? No, but on their own supposed superior wisdom and prudence. O how sad to see men of little experience put on airs of importance, and acted as though there own judgment of men and things were infallible. I know that things are not right now in the office."},{"refcode_short":"1888 1187.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Does it pay you to throw your reflections upon me, because someone says I said you were selfish. Is this an impossible thing, my brother in Christ Jesus I repeat the Lord did show me you were selfish, and you must see yourself as you have not yet done else you must assuredly make shipwreck of faith. When, O when has been your depth of piety, your zeal for God corresponding to the position you occupied. If you will resolve now to be whole hearted and unselfish, and persevering in your Lord's service, and will act with an eye single to his glory, discharging every duty, and improving every gracious opportunity then you will unlearn some lessons you have been learning the past few years, and will come into the school of Christ to learn of Jesus, and will if a diligent student realize a transformation of character, and receive Christ mold upon you, and become complete in Christ Jesus. You will be a partaker of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. The Lord will make you then a channel of light. In regard to yourself, you have been far from leading a life which would meet the requirements of God. And should accidental death surprise you I fear greatly for your future. I could not say it is well with Frank for he sleeps in Jesus; but I should greatly fear that you would in that great day be weighed in the “Balance and found wanting”. You had better lose everything on earth than heaven. No man can know what it means to be sanctified to God, unless he seeks first the kingdom of God and his righteousness. He must humble his soul before God, be ready to sacrifice anything and everything rather than the favor of God. Cultivate love and affection for religious devotion. Better far give up earth than heaven. You need now to look well to your ways, that your feet slide not. The character of every desire and purpose, is as clear you well know before God as the sun in the heavens. You have my dear brother in Christ not cultivated spirituality and grown in grace. Self in you must die. Self-importance must be laid in the dust. O remember that God is a present God, and that you have a fearful account to render at his bar unless your sins are washed away in his atoning blood of Jesus Christ. You should be able to say, “I have seen the Lord always before me, because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.” You must be renewed, transformed, converted, and your whole life should be ordered and fashioned after the likeness of Christ. God has given you capabilities, and talents to use wholly to his glory. God will not accept a divided half and half service. The comprehension of spiritual things has been growing dim, and the several years of experience you have had has not made you more susceptible to holy influences. The channels of thought, desires and actions have been growing deeper and broader by separation and habit and tending to a fixedness of character, and unless this is broken up as soon as possible, and your experience is of a different, higher and more unselfish order, it may be pursued as long as life lasts. There needs to be a great breaking up with you, and habits formed to meet the mind and will of God. For Christ's sake lay hold of the work. You will make a success if in performing Christian duties with faithfulness and regularity, if you will die to self and obedience will become habitual. You will consult your Bible. You will be much with God in prayer. You will bear an humble heart, broken testimony in the congregation. In all appropriate places you will be as humble as a little child. You work to save souls to Jesus Christ and shun the very appearance of evil and endeavor to constantly build up the kingdom of Jesus Christ. We must all soon meet him as he is, and you want sheaves to present to the Master. Your time, your talents are God's, use them to his glory. I press it home to your soul; you have no time to lose. It is life or death with you. Your Aunt Ellen loves your soul too well to gloss over your present condition. God has a work for you to do, and you can do it if you are truly and genuinely converted. You must not be hesitating and unreliable as you have been at times, your light flickering, and bewildering and betraying rather than guiding them in safe paths. O you must have a different experience. God help you my dear brother in Christ. God help you and Hattie that you will not turn away as you have done from his testimony given to you; but walk in the light. Put on the robe of Christ's righteousness. Prepare for heaven by yielding your soul, body, and spirit to God. Jesus has bought you with a price, God loves you both, and I am constrained by the love I have for Jesus and your souls to warn you to make no delay. Seek God day and night till you find him to the joy of your souls. I have labored earnestly for Byron. I expect he will be a laborer for the Master. I send you a letter I sent to him. He is in the school: I told him I would see him through this term. He is in need of all the light and knowledge of the word he can obtain. He is putting his whole mind to the work. God will help him. Your father is in straightened circumstances. I wrote to Willie to draw $2.00 per week from the Echo Office to add to what he shall earn to keep him, if he needs it. He shall not be brought in straightened, uncomfortable places, if I have to support him entirely; but he earns something carrying the students to and from the school. Vinnie is doing laundry work for the students, and she earns something, and your father works on the school grounds, and earns something there so we think he will get along. Byron has helped him a great deal, so much so, that when he lost his situation in the Office he had nothing left to use to go to school. But Byron has acted nobly to your father, constantly helping him, purchasing him entire suits of clothing and in many ways he has helped. Byron has been unselfish, liberal, and kind hearted may the Lord bless him, and give him wisdom and understanding."},{"refcode_short":"1888 1191.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

The inspired apostle continues, “Wherefore” in consideration of the warfare against, “not flesh and blood” but Satanic agencies, disguised, “take unto you the whole armor of God.” Make your guide the word. “Take” it. The whole armor which is furnished you in the Scriptures is all prepared for you to take. “Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all to stand.

While the living human agents are being moved with a power from beneath and the satanic agencies seem to have full control (almost) of the world, acting a conspicuous part just before the second appearing of our Lord to take the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever and ever, the two classes which are formed to enact the solemnities of the last day will be distinguished as the commandment-keeping people of God, and the commandment breakers who are inspired by the devil and his angels.

God will arise in mighty power, and show, though slow to anger, He will not acquit the wicked. The wickedness of each generation is not forgotten. Each century of increased profligacy has treasured up wrath, and Christ said unto those who resisted all His mercy, all the blessings He presented to them, addressing the rejecters of His salvation, “Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers,” for the blood of all the prophets which had been shed from the foundation of the world should be required of the nation He addressed. They had the beacon warning in the jealousies, in the hatred, in the despisings of warnings and messages sent to them and God's punishment came upon them for their cruelty, and notwithstanding all this, those who separated from God repeated the history of their fathers, and thus it is in our day."},{"refcode_short":"1888 1202.2","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

The fact is evident that they did not appreciate or walk in the light or follow the Light of the world. It is an easy matter to idle away, talk and play away the Holy Spirit's influence. Walk in the light is to keep moving onward in the direction of light.

There is work to be done to enlighten, to warn. Holy characters are to be presented to the world to represent the power of sacred truths upon human hearts. God's calls are earnest and emphatic to the sinner. He calls, “Turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye die?” Who is calling with Christ? My heart is weighed down with burden of distress because God's name is not glorified and exalted in the earth. If He sends His Holy Spirit there are those who do not understand its operations and how to appreciate the glory of God shining upon them, and unless they do discern the movings of the Spirit of God, they will call light darkness, and darkness will be chosen rather than light.

They were very punctilious in the observances of the church, very rigorous in following their forms, but they were destitute of vitality and religious devotion. They were represented by Christ as like the dry skins which were then used as bottles. The gospel of Christ could not be placed in their hearts; for there was no room to contain it. They could not be the new bottles into which he could pour his new wine. Christ was obliged to seek elsewhere than among the scribes and the Pharisees for bottles for his doctrine of truth and life. He must find men who were willing to have regeneration of heart. He came to give to men new hearts. He said, “A new heart also will I give you.” But the self-righteous of that day and of this day feel no need of having a new heart. Jesus passed by the scribes and the Pharisees, for they felt no need of a Saviour. They were wedded to forms and ceremonies. These services had been instituted by Christ; they had been full of vitality and spiritual beauty; but the Jews had lost the spiritual life from their ceremonies, and clung to the dead forms after spiritual life was extinct among them. When they departed from the requirements and commandments of God, they sought to supply the place of that which they had lost, by multiplying their own requirements, and making more rigorous demands than had God; and the more rigid they grew, the less of the love and Spirit of God they manifested. Christ said to the people: “The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses seat: all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do ye not after their works: for they say, and do not. For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers. But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, and love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi....

Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.” The love of God has been waning in the church, and as a result, the love of self has sprung up into new activity. With the loss of love for God there has come the loss of love for the brethren. The church may meet all the description that is given of the Ephesian church, and yet fail in vital godliness.

I must believe that you would not have done this if you had only known the situation. I am now able to understand more perfectly the light given me when my husband was so feeble in Greenville, Michigan. That was the beginning of divine directions concerning means. I was shown that the Lord would have my husband and myself independent of all our institutions, in financial matters. Our brethren would make many plans to gain control of the profits from our books and other publications, but we must keep the means to use as the Lord directed us. We could understand the wants of the cause better than others; God would teach us how to dispose of the means. He would bring into our possession to be used to his own name's glory. Again, at a later date, cautions were repeated, that since my husband's death propositions would be made in regard to our books and publications, that the profits should be under the control of one organization. But I was warned not to shift the responsibility of my stewardship upon any institution or organization; when I should see the needs of the cause in its various branches, then I must act, even though my brethren did not discern the necessity as I saw it. If I called upon men in responsible positions, even for the means which God has intrusted to me, unless they themselves were in a condition to understand the wants of the cause as they were presented before me and urged upon me, these brethren would give counsel to divert that means into other channels. This is why I did not feel free to accept the proposition that I should assign the royalty on my books. I could not conscientiously do so. When after the Minneapolis meeting, the canvassing agents in the field so managed the work that my books fell nearly dead from the press, and when I endeavored to draw means from the publishing house at Battle Creek, and was informed that I had over-drawn my account, and could have no more money, I was made to feel keenly how little safety there would be in leaving my brethren to bear my responsibility.

Every soul must needs be tested, every faith and doctrine must needs be tried by the law and the testimony. Take heed that no man deceive you. The warnings of Christ on this matter are needed at this time; for delusions and deceptions will come in among us, and will multiply as we near the end. “Of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.

They will say, Why did we accept some things that we needed, and why did we accept other things that we should have let alone? Why was not the danger-signal lifted? There has been danger for years. Men who have been chosen of God to do a special work have been imperiled because the people have looked to the men in the place of looking to God. When Eld. Butler was president of the General Conference, ministers placed Eld. Butler and Eld. Smith and some others where God alone should be. The brethren made grave mistakes, and the Lord sent messages of truth to correct their errors, and to lead them into safe paths. But in spite of the reproofs that have been given to the people, they still make men their trust, and exalt and glorify the human agent, and this grave error is repeated again and again. The Lord has chosen men to bear light and messages of great importance to the people in these last days. After years of perseverance under difficulties, the Lord has given marked success to his truth, and the “lo, here! and lo, there!” have arisen on every side, and yet the message has sounded on. Every inch of the ground had to be fought in presenting the present message, and some have not been reconciled with the providence of God in selecting the very men whom he did select to bear this special message. They ask, why it is that he has not chosen the who have been long in the work? The reason is that he knew that these men who had had long experience would not do the work in God's way, and after God's order. God has chosen the very men he wanted, and we have reason to thank him that these men have carried forward the work with faithfulness, and have been the mouth-piece for God. Now because they have not seen all things distinctly, because they were in danger, the Lord sent them a warning, and let every soul who loves God, thank the Lord for his mercies. What! Shall we thank God that these men were going too fast, and were endorsing productions that were not of heavenly origin?—No, but thank the Lord that they did not resist the message of warning that the Lord saw fit to give them, and thus they did not repeat the grave error that some have made for years in resisting the Spirit of God. Thank God they did hear his voice, and at once obeyed it. In this matter, the churches have the greatest evidence that these men are chosen of the Lord. He has given them a message, and has wrought through them; for they knew the voice of counsel from heaven, and have obeyed it. The voice of warning, of counsel, of instruction has appealed to men who have been intrusted with sacred duties, and who bear weighty responsibilities in the Review and Herald office, and yet, though God has warned them early and late to do certain things and to leave certain things undone, all have not heard the voice, or listened to the words of instruction. Did the men who have thus been warned step quickly into the path that was marked out for them, as these two brethren have done?—No, they did not. They chose to follow in their own selfish, human counsel, and have led others into false paths. Some who have been warned have imperiled their souls, some will never more see the way, because darkness has come upon them, and they have virtually said, We want not thy way, O God, we want our own way. Now had the men who had been intrusted with God's word, walked with fearfulness and trembling before him, and not in the imagination of their own hearts, God would have been glorified, and souls would have been saved unto eternal life. Let them now engage in close searching of heart. Let them examine themselves as with a lighted candle; for the perils of the last days are upon us. Let not those who have neglected to receive light and truth take advantage of the mistake of their brethren, and put forth their finger, and speak words of vanity, because the chosen of God have been too ardent in their ideas, and have carried certain matters in too strong a manner. We have need of these ardent elements; for our work is not a passive work; our work is aggressive. Let those men who have not received draught from the wells of Bethlehem, consider how much has been lost in their not finding their place and their lot in doing the very work that God would have them do. Had these men of experience who have failed to do their part, stood in the paths of God's choosing, and followed not the counsel of men but the counsel of God, they would have connected with the men who were to give the message which the people needed in these last days. God would have worked through them, and the work would have advanced much more rapidly than it has They could have done a most precious work, if they had not cherished a spirit that was not pleasing to God, and that closed their hearts to the working of the Holy Spirit. They entered into temptation, and did not yield to evidence, but began to question, to find fault and to oppose. This was their attitude, and because of their unbelief, God could not use them to his name's glory. They grieved the Spirit of God Had they walked in obedience to the light their experience in the rise and advancement of the third angel's message would have been of value in helping to make complete the work for this time; but they refused to fill the position for which they were fitted, and failed to do the work for which God had qualified them, and they thought they could discern many flaws in the men whom God was using. The chosen agents of God would have been rejoiced to link up with the men who held aloof from them, questioning, criticizing, and opposing. If the union had existed between these brethren, which Christ in his lessons has enjoined upon his disciples, mistakes and errors which have occurred would have been avoided. But if the men who should have used their experience in furthering the work, have labored to hinder it, and mistakes have occurred that would not have occurred if they had stood in their allotted place, whom will God hold accountable for these late errors? He will hold the very men accountable who should have been united with the faithful watchmen in these days of peril. But where were they?—They were holding themselves in the position of those who were non-receivers of the light for themselves, and intercepting the light that God would send to others. They placed themselves between God and the light, and they have lost the precious light and peace which they did have, and have lost also, the most precious draught from the fountain of light and life. They have placed themselves where reliance could not be placed upon them as upon God's chosen men of opportunity."},{"refcode_short":"1888 1248.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

But while we should be careful not to go into human excitement, we should not be among those who will raise inquiries, and cherish doubts in reference to the work of the Spirit of God; for there will be those who will question and criticize when the Spirit of God takes possession of men and women, because their hearts are not moved; but are cold and unimpressible."},{"refcode_short":"1888 1251.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Let all our brethren read the first few chapters of Acts, and see how the Lord has worked and how he will work where faith is cherished in the hearts of his people. Let nothing be done through strife or vain glory; but let everyone serve God with pure, clean, unselfish hearts, having an eye single to the glory of God. We need power from above, a more than mortal power to accompany the proclamation of the last message of mercy to our world.

Christ said, “A little while is the light with you, walk while you have the light, lest darkness come upon you.” The intellect may be cultivated, and through the harmonious use of our faculties, we may develop a strong, firm character. A righteous character formed after the likeness of Christ's character has a value above that of gold or precious stones. Those who co-operate with the Lord Jesus Christ in the formation of a righteous character will become laborers together with God. They will act their part as the human agent through whom God will reach the hearts and minds of men and women who are separated from him by sin, and will win them to Christ. No one can copy the pattern Christ Jesus without becoming a channel of light to influence others. No man liveth unto himself. God has claims upon us individually and in our short probationary life he requires us to put into exercise the powers he has granted us, to love one another as he has loved us. We are not to labor merely keeping this short life time in view; but to act as if in sight of eternity, we are to act as if the curtain between us and the universe of heaven was withdrawn, and we could with the eye of faith, see Christ looking upon us, and encouraging us in our work. Study diligently the lessons he gave to his disciples; for he declared, “The words I speak unto you, they are Spirit and they are life.” There is marrow and fatness in these lessons. Christ has prayed to his Father for his disciples.

Ministers should set before the people the lessons which are to be brought into the home life.

They see that there is a work to be done for the world which will require earnest zeal and energy, self-denial, and self-sacrifice for Christ. A higher, holier type of Christianity than we have seen for many years will be revealed. We need so much, the divine touch, that we may no longer work on according to our ease-loving, indifferent, low standard. But when the church is properly educated, and its members wisely trained, both old and young will have a mind to work.

He is soon to come again with power and great glory. Those who are not wedded to the world will realize that the time demands something more than a weak, faint, methodical discourse. They will see that there must be earnestness and power accompanying the word which will arouse the powers of hell to oppose the warnings God designs to come to the people to awaken men out of their carnal security, that they may prepare themselves for the great event right upon us. The promise is, “Ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you; and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.” God will accept no sleepy, tame message at this time. In old time “Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost,” and we may expect such teaching in our day. I know that the Lord has wrought by his own power in Battle Creek. Let no one attempt to deny this; for in so doing they will sin against the Holy Ghost. Because there may be need to warn and caution every one to walk carefully and prayerfully, in order that the deceptive influence of the enemy shall not lead men away from the Bible, let no one suppose that God will not manifest his power among his believing people; for he will work and none can hinder him. His name will be a praise in the earth. “After these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.” Some souls will see and receive the light; but those who have stood long in resistance of light, because it did not come just in accordance with their ideas, will be in danger of calling light darkness, and darkness light; but the power of God will sweep away the refuge of lies, and his glory will be revealed. Let not one ray of light be resisted, let no operation of the Spirit of God be interpreted as darkness. God will not leave his people to wrestle with principalities and powers, with the rulers of the darkness of this world, with spiritual wickedness in high places, without the co-operation of heavenly angels.

Some who did not receive their counsel from God, prepared a resolution, which was carried, that no one should labor as a minister unless he first made a success in the canvassing field.

When they have this experience these weak, tempted souls will look unto Jesus and say, “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.” They need to appreciate every ray of light that comes from the throne of God into their pathway. They need to catch the Spirit and principle of the holy law of God, and conform their life to the character of Christ. A new power takes possession of the new heart. Man can never work out this change for himself. It is a supernatural work, bringing a supernatural element into weak and wicked human nature.

It was made clear to me that light would be rejected, that warnings would be despised, that a spirit of selfishness would be cultivated in the Office, and that men would act from worldly principles, and depart from the law of God. They would give heed to the promptings of the enemy, and would turn human agents away from their right. Religious and business liberty they would labor to control. They would work to have every Seventh Day Adventist institution in subordination to the institution in Battle Creek, and manipulate things so that every branch of the work would be centered and controlled by responsible men in the Review & Herald Office. This is what men are doing, and acting as if every branch of the work, both high and afar off, must come under the jurisdiction of men in Battle Creek, and that every one must circle around their orbit. But the Lord has given light to the effect that our different institutions must stand by themselves. These men are carrying on their counsels, and acting as though God in person had spoken by them. They bear themselves loftily toward the purchase of Christ's blood. They act as though every individual must acknowledge their sway, and use his ability and talent as they may direct. If he will not come under their control they crush him out or treat him with indifference. They consider it is an abomination to be unsubmissive, and those who do not submit to their jurisdiction are left without sympathy, without help or support.

Those who have Christ enthroned within will manifest Christlike principles. They will make it evident that the Holy Spirit has imparted a new life to them, and that they are nourishing and cherishing that life. Its beginning is found in spiritual union with the Lord Jesus Christ, and as they go on increasing in the knowledge of God, they will manifest growth in grace, and will show Christlike love to others. Men in responsible positions are to guard the interests of others as jealously as they would guard their own interests. Thus they are to love their neighbors as themselves. Christians are to be channels for currents of heavenly wisdom and grace. They are to connect themselves, not with the low streams of the valley, but with the living snow-waters of Lebanon. All outward forms and ceremonies that are not after the pattern shown them in the Mount will prove valueless. The grace of God is made manifest in the exercise of the love which dwelt in the bosom of Jesus, and which bringeth salvation to the lost. The kingdom of God cometh not by observation. Unselfish love is to work through every plan that is made, and the fruit of unselfish love is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. Those who are not spiritual often appear to have a zeal that far exceeds the zeal of the true children of God. This is because they are determined that their ways and their plans shall succeed. They say to themselves, I will put the whole force of my being into this plan, and I will work continually until I see it succeed. I will persist until I prevail. But all the religion that a man has is found in this ambitious zeal he thinks is after the Christlike order. Take away this, and nothing is left. They are like the Pharisees who tithed mint, and arise, and cummin, but neglected the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and the love of God. The truth is of the deepest importance. In the sacrifice of Christ for fallen men, mercy and truth met together, righteousness and peace kissed each other. When you separate these attributes from the most wonderful, and apparently the most successful work, there is nothing to it. Those who work with Christ unite their business services with spiritual consecration. Where this combination exists, there is no lordly oppression, no compulsion of manner. God has given to his children their work individually.

No. David left Solomon to do a work that he should have done himself in condemning wrongs.

You are not to hold yourself to seek permission of the authorities of Battle Creek whether you shall or shall not pursue a line of work that seems impressed upon you to do. The Lord is the one to whom you are to be amenable. All the light heretofore given me of God is that these institutions out of Battle Creek should not be absorbed by Battle Creek. It would be an injury to both parties. Each is to stand in harmony one with the other, yet preserve their individuality of action, responsible to God and Him alone. If one pursues a course of selfish action, or of absorbing everything by just or unjust means, my voice cannot be silent. I shall be heard, for God has given me His word.

I send you warning not to follow in their wake; for God has a controversy with them and He will not serve with their selfish plans, neither will He accept robbery for a burnt offering. That which they unjustly require for themselves they are very jealous to accord to others. God hates covetousness, which is idolatry. I tell you in the fear of God, stand in God to do His will, to keep the ways of the Lord, to do justice and judgment.

If God sees the least injustice done to one of His children He will punish for these things.

When men educate others to rely upon men, to look to and to trust in men, when they dictate to others what they shall do, by pen or voice, and what they shall not do, they are educating their brethren to make flesh their arm, to trust in men, and to give glory to humanity rather than to God.

The means that is thus expended will testify against them. You should put wise calculation into exercise and scatter the influence that is centering in Battle Creek, and diffuse the light that God has given you. Blessed are those that sow beside all waters. The more means you invest in Battle Creek, the greater will be the demand for investing more; but this is not in the order of God, and before a great period of time shall pass the mistake of centering interests in Battle Creek, will be made evident. Advantages in Battle Creek mean destitution in other places: for other localities are robbed of the means that is expended in Battle Creek. The money should be invested in enterprises elsewhere, in establishing souls in the truth and in providing houses of worship for them. In adding building to building are we not encouraging neglect to other fields? God has pointed out the fact that it is the duty of those in Battle Creek to help institutions in other places, As a wise steward of means, you should scatter your forces, and diffuse the power of your influence to help people who know not God as he is. How many cities and towns are left in utter neglect? You are doing your own selves an injury in thus crowding together. When trees in a nursery are crowded thickly together, they cannot grow healthfully and sturdily. Give room, put your plants in many places, and work to a purpose. Make known the precious light to those that are in darkness. We are not half awake to the worth of souls for whom Christ has died. The means expended in enlarging your advantages in Battle Creek, that are already over-grown, and have passed beyond reasonable limits, should be used in establishing missionary stations in other places. You should broaden your plans and widen the field of your operations. You should transplant your trees and give them room to grow. The Lord demands this of you. You have a superabundance of facilities, and should send wise men into cities and towns, who which have not yet had a chance to hear the gospel. Pick out the very best men you can possibly spare, and give them a chance to become care-takers and bearers of burdens. Let them have an opportunity to develop the talents which they have not been encouraged to use in the past. Furnish them with a place in which they can use their God-given abilities in calling sinners to repentance both by precept and example. Let men who make it manifest that they love God have a chance to do something for him. All the preaching in the world will not make men feel deeply for the perishing souls around them. Nothing will so stir up a missionary, self-sacrificing zeal as to go into the field, and seek to reach those who are in darkness. Prepare workers to go into the highways and hedges, and do not use your facilities to call men and women to the great center, and encourage them to leave churches that need their aid.

For this reason no man should have a responsible connection with our institutions who thinks it no important matter whether he has a heart of flesh or a heart of steel. Men think they are representing the justice of God, and they do not represent his tenderness and the great love wherewith he has loved us. Their human inventions, originating with the specious devices of Satan, appears fair enough to the blinded eyes of men, because it is inherent in their nature.

In some cases the first principles have a measure of truth interwoven with the error, but it does not lead to any just action and this is why men are misled.

He was indeed in possession of talents of no ordinary character.

Jesus virtually says to Nicodemus, it is not controversy that will help your case, it is not arguments that will bring light to the soul. You must have a new heart, or you cannot discern the kingdom of heaven. It is not greater evidence that will bring you into a right position, but new purposes, new springs of action; you must be born again.

The Saviour “turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him. Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou? He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour. One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.” After hearing the gracious words that proceeded from the lips of Jesus, words that flashed light into their minds, the hearts of the disciples were aglow with faith and assurance that this was indeed the Messiah. With inexpressible love their hearts went out to Jesus, and they did not sit down in happy contemplation, to hear more and more of the gracious words. They wanted others to have the same knowledge they had received. Andrew went in search of some one to whom he might tell the wonderful story, that seemed almost too good to be true. He first found his brother Simon, and said to him, “We have found the Messias;” and he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, “Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation a stone.”"},{"refcode_short":"1888 1460.2","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

He could not keep the glad tidings, and enjoy alone the privilege of following Jesus. He knew that his companion Nathanael was searching the prophecies; they had prayed most earnestly to understand the Scriptures; but where was Nathanael? He was then praying to God under a fig-tree. Philip discovered his retreat, for they had often prayed together in this secluded spot, hidden by the foliage. As soon as Philip found his friend, he declared, “We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” But Nathanael had heard what a wicked place Nazareth was, and this statement aroused his prejudice. He queried, “Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?” Philip entered into no controversy, but said, “Come and see.” Thus the truth came to Nathanael. As he listened to the words of Christ, faith, simple, full, and complete, was expressed. Jesus said of him, “Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee. Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel. Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these. And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.”"},{"refcode_short":"1888 1462.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Some have treated the Spirit as an unwelcome guest, refusing to receive the rich gift, refusing to acknowledge it, turning from it, and condemning it as fanaticism. When the Holy Spirit works the human agent, it does not ask us in what way it shall operate. Often it moves in unexpected ways. Christ did not come as the Jews expected. He did not come in a manner to glorify them as a nation. His forerunner came to prepare the way for him by calling upon the people to repent of their sins and be converted, and be baptized. Christ's message was, “The kingdom of heaven is at hand; repent ye and believe the gospel.” The Jews refused to receive Christ, because he did not come in accordance with their expectations. The ideas of finite men were held as infallible, because hoary with age. This is the danger to which the church is now exposed,—that the inventions of finite men shall mark out the precise way for the Holy Spirit to come. Though they would not care to acknowledge it, some have already done this. And because the Spirit is to come, not to praise men or to build up their erroneous theories, but to reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment, many turn away from it. They are not willing to be deprived of the garments of their own self-righteousness. They are not willing to exchange their own righteousness, which is unrighteousness, for the righteousness of Christ, which is pure, unadulterated truth.

Life itself is a talent of great value; for when health is once lost, it may be gone for good as far as this world is concerned. Just as long as life is granted to a human being, that human being, whether man, woman or child, is under obligation to employ his entrusted talent in God's service, keeping himself in the most healthful conditions, that he may offer to God an acceptable sacrifice, which is his reasonable service. When man by faith walks with God, he uses the great talent of life to the best advantage. As far as possible, he should keep mind, soul, and body in a healthful condition, that his discernment may be clear, that he may understand spiritual things. He must not be so devoted to common business things that he will make no difference between the sacred and the common, and like Nadab and Abihu neglect the special requirement that associates his service with a holy God.

We are only his workers, to obey orders; what he saith, that will we do. We have no need to be anxious or troubled. God is our trust. The Lord sends his richest endowments of reason and reasoning to a people he loves, and who keep his commandments. He has by no means forsaken his people who are working in his lines. God is seeking to make his church the continued incarnation of Christ. The gospel ministers are the under-shepherds, Christ is the divine shepherd. The members of the church are the working agencies of the Lord. His church will stand out prominently. It is the Lord's body. With all its working forces it must become one with the great Head.

Such men are bringing in false theories and principles and converting Elder Olsen to voice their unjust plans and methods, which are bringing the curse of God upon our institutions."},{"refcode_short":"1888 1816","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

He did not give an equivalent for the high wages he received, even from a business standpoint. In regard to the religious side of the question, he was not to be depended on. He did not conscientiously maintain principle. He worked in a way that could not receive God's endorsement."},{"refcode_short":"1888 1816.3","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

But they had no more respect for the testimonies than for any other literary production, and left them far behind, unnoticed and neglected. They put Bible Readings in the place of Great Controversy. I was treated by them with an indifference savoring of contempt. They had the power which position, but not the Lord, gave them, and the wages allotted them were contrary to the principles which the Lord had revealed as those that should ever be strenuously maintained."},{"refcode_short":"1888 1817.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

The Lord was willing for it to be so; but I had not one ray of light that he would have me come to this country. I came in submission to the voice of the General Conference, which I have ever maintained to be authority. I have no wish to return to America. I feel a holy indignation striving within my soul as I review the past eight years. Testimony after testimony has been sent from God to those in our publishing houses and to the managers of the work, who stand at the very head; but they have turned away from the God-given light, to listen to the voice of men."},{"refcode_short":"1888 1817.2","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Had he been converted and sanctified, and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, his qualifications would have presented a far different showing. But he was connected with men who were not connected with God. There was not that harmony and love in the hearts of the workers, high or low, which could have made them strong and efficient, a complete whole. Those who were connected to the most sacred work ever given to men in these last days,—the work of preparing a people to stand in moral integrity as representatives of the character and work of Christ,—dishonored God by mingling selfishness with the work. Man-made methods and practices that the word of God has positively refused to acknowledge, were brought in. The wisdom of finite men was placed in opposition to the wisdom of God."},{"refcode_short":"1888 1818.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Their wisdom was earthborn, and the Lord declared he would blow upon all that was acquired in this way. All their ability, all their talents, were lent them by God; they did not create them. Had they been eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the Son of God, what would have been their experience? “He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.” “As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father, even so he shall live by me.”"},{"refcode_short":"1888 1818.2","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

Messages may be brought to them from the Lord, but these messages will be just as incomprehensible as the words spoken by our Saviour to his disciples.

But to whom are they responsible for their reason and ability. “As I live by the Father, so he that eateth me shall live by me.” Unless those who are connected with the work of God bring the words of Christ into their every day practice, they will see something at which to be offended, as did the disciples, and will turn away from Christ. “It is the Spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing; the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.”"},{"refcode_short":"1888 1819.3","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

If left to themselves, they will soon reveal their natural temperaments; unsanctified selfishness will be exhibited; human wisdom will occupy the throne of the heart. Men supposed to be sensible men, having discerning minds, will follow their own light, light which heaven has not originated. They will use strange fire in their service, but the Lord will not accept them. When these men see their own inefficiency, and discern how small all their human calculations are, they will realize that without a living connection with God, their influence will be misleading. They, will see that the advancement and healthy growth of God's work is not dependent upon unsanctified men."},{"refcode_short":"1888 1820.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

They are little in their own eyes, and will not interpret success as the result of their own smartness, but will glorify God. “Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord.” If men are entrusted with great responsibilities, this is no assurance of their fitness for their position. The assurance comes after test and trial. If they evidence that they sense their own weakness, if they make God their trust, the Lord will supply them with his wisdom. If they ask in faith, they will increase in knowledge and ability. If they depend upon God day by day, the stages of development will show a symmetrical growth heavenward. If they walk day by day in humility and contrition and wholeheartedness, in the strictest integrity doing justice to their fellow-men, showing reverence and honor to God by being obedient and true to him, keeping the living principles of righteousness, God will honor them."},{"refcode_short":"1888 1821.1","refcode_long":"The Ellen G.

In the place of becoming faint-hearted and discouraged, those to whom God has entrusted responsibilities, are to see in every difficulty a call to prayer. They are to consult, not finite men, who are boastful and show a masterly independence, but the great Teacher who has given to every man his work in his vineyard. They are to be faithful workers, always in co-partnership with the great worker. Then they will not call slackly done work faithful and thorough service. They will stand fast against wrong, discerning the right from the wrong, the evil from the good. They will appreciate that which God estimates. There is no favoritism with God, and no partiality, no hypocrisy should be introduced or maintained in our households, churches, or institutions."}]
