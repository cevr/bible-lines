New principles must be developed as well as talked. In the place where all should walk humbly before God, there must be no large care for business and little care to understand whether the Lord Jesus is presiding. Begin your work every morning with prayer. The Lord says, “Them that honour Me I will honour” (1 Samuel 2:30). If you educate the workers in every department to invite the presence of the Lord Jesus, and begin the work with softened and subdued hearts, no loud-voiced ordering or sharp words will be heard. No harsh spirit will be manifested by men and women who believe that Christ is in the room. This is the reformation needed. The workers in every room are to be transformed into a Christian-endeavor company to help one another to please Christ by gentleness, good temper, and sunshine in the heart. Sweetness, gentleness, patience, longsuffering, love, and the strictest integrity must be manifested by those who stand at the head of every working force, because Christ is present, to see how His character is lived before the workmen.

As you take time to pray with the workers, you can take half an hour to introduce the heavenly Guest, and then ask if there are present those who would have you pray especially for them. Do not consider this wasted time, for by this means success and spiritual victory will be brought in. The machinery will respond to the touch of the Master's hand. God's blessing is certainly worth asking for, and the work cannot be done aright unless the beginning is right. The hands of every worker must be greatly strengthened, his heart purified before the Lord can use him satisfactorily.

At this meeting I bore testimony that the most precious light had been shining forth from the Scriptures in the presentation of the great subject of the righteousness of Christ connected with the law, which should be constantly kept before the sinner as his only hope of salvation. This was not new light to me, for it had come to me from higher authority for the last forty-four years, and I had presented it to our people by pen and voice in the testimonies of His Spirit.

Angels have striven, earnestly longed, to look into this wonderful mystery. It is a study that can tax the highest human intelligence, that man, fallen, deceived by Satan, taking Satan's side of the question, can be conformed to the image of the Son of the infinite God—that man shall be like Him, that, because of the righteousness of Christ given to man, God will love man, fallen but redeemed, even as He loved His Son.

It is to be the groundwork of every discourse. There have been dry theories presented and precious souls are starving for the bread of life. This is not the preaching that is required or that the God of heaven will accept, for it is Christless. The divine picture of Christ must be kept before the people. He is that Angel standing in the sun of heaven. He reflects no shadows. Clothed in the attributes of Deity, shrouded in the glories of Deity, and in the likeness of the infinite God, He is to be lifted up before men. When this is kept before the people, creature merit sinks into insignificance. The more the eye looks upon Him, the more His life, His lessons, His perfection of character are studied, the more sinful and abhorrent will sin appear. By beholding, man can but admire and become more attracted to Him, more charmed, and more desirous to be like Jesus until he assimilates to His image and has the mind of Christ.

If every minister who claims to love Jesus will only be filled with His charms and become assimilated to His image, what an example would he give to his brethren and to the world! The more ministers are in the company of Christ by communing with Him, the more they will be fastened to Christ.

In representing Christ we represent God to our world. “If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His” (Romans 8:9). Let us inquire, Are we reflecting in the church and before the world the character of Jesus Christ? A great deal deeper study is required of us in searching the Scriptures.

To consider that these were the ones who had the guardianship of the flock of God was painful. The destitution of true faith, the hands hung down, because not lifted up in sincere prayer!

No. Christ declared, “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill” [Matthew 5:17].

Though entirely innocent, Christ submitted to be punished for man's disobedience. In His own body He offered the antitypical sacrifice, thus paying the penalty and bearing the curse, that no one who believes in Him should perish, but have everlasting life.

The human did not become divine, nor the divine human. Christ lived the law of God, showing all men and women that through His grace they can do the same. By faith, in His humanity Christ saw what we are permitted to see by faith—the atoning sacrifice connected with the Lord upon the mercy seat. The golden censer is waved, and the incense, the representation of the purity and righteousness of Christ, ascends, bearing the prayers of every soul that receives and believes on Christ to the altar which is before the throne of God.

Christ was the object of that justice. In the place of the sinner, the spotless Son of God received the penalty, and the sinner goes free as long as he receives and holds Christ as his personal Saviour. Though guilty, he is looked upon as innocent. The character of God was shown to the world by the obedience and death of the Son of God. By His own merits Christ covered everything that the justice of God demanded. God's character as a God of holiness, a God of goodness, compassion, and love combined, was expressed in His Son. In the cross of Christ God gave the mightiest pledge of justice and love.

The lamb prefiguring Christ—for to Him all the sacrificial offerings pointed—had been brought to be slain. Clothed in his significant and beautiful dress, the priest stood with lifted knife, as did Abraham when he was about to slay his son. With intense interest the people look on. But the earth trembles and quakes, for the Lord Himself draws near. With a rending noise, the veil of the Temple is torn from top to bottom by an unseen hand, throwing open to the gaze of the multitude a place once filled with the presence of God. In this place the Shekinah once dwelt. Here God had once manifested His glory above the mercy seat. No one but the high priest ever lifted the veil separating this apartment from the rest of the tabernacle. He entered in once a year to make an atonement for the sin of the people.

At the moment that the expiring Saviour exclaimed, “It is finished,” an unseen hand rent the veil of the Temple from the top to the bottom. Thus God said, “I can no longer reveal My presence in the Most Holy Place.” Type had met antitype in the death of God's Son. The Lamb of God, slain from the foundation of the world, is dead. The way into the Holiest of all is laid open. A new and living way, which has no veil between, is offered to all. From henceforth all may walk in this way. No longer need sinful, sorrowing humanity await the coming of the high priest. It was as if a living voice had spoken to the worshipers: There is now an end to all sacrifices and offerings. The Son of God has come according to His word, “Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of Me, I delight to do thy will, O My God” [Psalm 40:8]. “Behold the lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world” [John 1:29]."},{"refcode_short":"12MR 417.1","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 12 [Nos. 921-999], p. 417.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"At the setting of the sun on the evening of the preparation, trumpets sounded, signifying that the Sabbath of rest had begun.

White-turbaned priests, in their officiating dress, full of busy activity, were preparing to perform their duties. But some present were not at rest as they offered the blood of bulls and goats for the sin of Israel.

The trumpets and musical instruments and the voices of the singers were as loud and clear as usual, but a sense of strangeness pervaded everything. One after another inquired about the strange event that had taken place. Hitherto the Most Holy Place had always been most sacredly guarded from intrusion. It was left in sacred solitude. Only once a year was it entered, and then by the high priest. But now a curious horror is seen on many countenances, for this apartment was open to all eyes. At the very moment that Christ had expired, the heavy veil of tapestry, made of pure linen, and beautifully wrought with scarlet and purple, had been rent from top to bottom. The place where Jehovah had met with the priest, to communicate His glory, the place that had been God's sacred audience chamber, lay open to every eye—a place no longer recognized by the Lord."},{"refcode_short":"12MR 418.1","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 12 [Nos. 921-999], p. 418.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Many who at that time united in the services of the Passover never again took part in them.

He had been among the number spoken of by John: “Among the chief rulers also many believed on Him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue” [John 12:42]. But Nicodemus had endeavored, as far as he could, to defend Christ. On one occasion he had asked the priests, “Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?” [John 7:51]. “Art thou also of Galilee?” was the retort. “Search, and look; for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet” [verse 52]."},{"refcode_short":"12MR 420.1","refcode_long":"Manuscript Releases, vol. 12 [Nos. 921-999], p. 420.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"After the crucifixion Nicodemus came to the cross, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes to embalm Christ's body.
