White during her sojourn in Australia. Except for an occasional reference to the local field, the reader would not detect that the writer was in another continent, for the instruction is world wide in its scope. It is a fact, nevertheless, that the revelations given to Mrs. White had a direct bearing on current issues and the development of the work at the time of writing. It is understandable, therefore, that there are represented in this volume topics which were related to the lines of work being developed in the Australasian field during this period. Publication of the book took place in the year 1901, after Mrs. White had returned to the United States."},{"refcode_short":"6T 3.2","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 3.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In its topical arrangement, volume 6 is quite different from the preceding five volumes. Up to this time the testimonies had first appeared in pamphlets and small books as counsel was progressively given for the Church. The articles were printed largely in chronological order, and dealt with almost every phase of Christian experience and every line of denominational work. As the content of these thirty-three publications was reprinted in volumes 1 to 5, the original order was left unchanged. A number of the articles were communications addressed first to individuals and later published for the church because the cases presented illustrated the experience of many others. Some of the articles dealt with local situations and special issues. There was some repetition of thought, as important lines of truth were stressed again and again as the Church was in danger of neglecting some line of work or of letting slip some church standard. These testimonies bore rich fruit in the lives of Seventh-day Adventists and in the work of the denomination."},{"refcode_short":"6T 3.3","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 3.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"With the publication of volume 6, eleven years after volume 5 was issued, the Testimonies for the Church took on a new form. The work of the denomination, now becoming world wide in its scope, presented needs and problems which called forth considerable counsel and instruction in certain particular lines. This represented largely an amplification of lines of instruction presented in earlier years and a re-emphasis of counsel. Consequently it was not difficult, when the articles for volume 6 were gathered for publication, to arrange them in topical order."},{"refcode_short":"6T 4.1","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 4.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"That Mrs. White might assist in the starting of a training school in Australia, she was asked to go to that field in 1891. She led out in the appeals for the school and assisted in laying plans for the work. Being in a new field, there was little by way of past experience or precedent to influence the plans. Under these favorable circumstances, and with the spirit of prophecy counsels to guide and guard, the Australasian Missionary College was established in a backward country region. From this training center, Australian youth, with the practical education gained at Avondale, were to serve in the home fields and to penetrate the far-flung islands of the South Pacific. In its rural environment, in its broad industrial program, and in some other features the Avondale school was to become a pattern school. As the instruction concerning the conduct of our educational work was presented anew to guide and mold this institution, entering into the many details of location, finance, curriculum, discipline, and administration, it was included in this volume for the benefit of the church around the world."},{"refcode_short":"6T 4.2","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 4.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"When Mrs. White reached Australian Shores, she found a work well begun, but still in its infancy. In the aggressive evangelistic program which was developed and fostered, not only the evangelists themselves were engaged in service, but in not a few cases they were joined by their wives in giving Bible studies and sometimes in preaching. Several well-planned evangelistic camp meetings were held, which were carefully followed up so as to conserve the harvest. There were many conversions, followed by baptisms and the organizing of new churches and the building of meetinghouses."},{"refcode_short":"6T 5.1","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 5.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Not only in the planning for the work was the influence of the spirit of prophecy felt, but Mrs. White herself took an active part in preaching, in personal work, and in assisting in the raising of money for the new church buildings. Counsel regarding these phases of our work is found in this volume."},{"refcode_short":"6T 5.2","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 5.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"It was in the times of volume 6 that Seventh-day Adventists became more fully mission conscious and accepted the whole world as a field of labor. The building and launching of the mission boat, “Pitcairn,” in California in 1890 fired the imagination of young and old alike and focused attention on an around-the-world mission program. The reports of the voyages of the “Pitcairn,” as it pioneered mission work in the South Sea Islands, were eagerly watched by all."},{"refcode_short":"6T 5.3","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 5.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"It was not long until colporteur evangelists entered India with our literature, and in 1894 our missionaries in Africa pushed up into distinctively native territories and established the Solusi Mission, our first foreign mission among heathen peoples. Ministers were also soon sent into South America. Then, too, Mrs. White's presence in Australia for nine years as a pioneer worker helped to keep the eyes of Seventh-day Adventists on the ends of the earth and to place emphasis on the admonition given on page 31 of this volume: “It is our work to give to the whole world,—to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people,—the saving truths of the third angel's message.” Throughout the volume various mission fields are mentioned by name, and appeals for men and means are presented, together with counsel and encouragement concerning the work in different lands."},{"refcode_short":"6T 5.4","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 5.4 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"A number of colleges and worker training schools were started during the times of volume 6. Early in the period Union College at Lincoln, Nebraska, was opened in 1891 and Walla Walla College in the state of Washington in 1892. The others were in Australia, South Africa, and Denmark. Sanitariums were also opened at Boulder, Colorado, in 1896, in Denmark and South Africa in 1897, and at South Lancaster, Massachusetts, in 1899. Two new publishing houses were added to the list of institutions, one in Hamburg, Germany, in 1895, and the other in Buenos Aires, South America, in 1897. Church schools presenting elementary work were also begun in several places."},{"refcode_short":"6T 6.1","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 6.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Though many warnings were given against large denominational centers and centralizing tendencies, the steadily growing work seemed to require more people and larger facilities at our denominational headquarters at Battle Creek, Michigan, and plans were even initiated to bring certain lines of denominational work under central control at Battle Creek. Thus instead of the plans for the work of various sections of the field being laid by those on the ground, they were directed largely from the home offices in Battle Creek. This had the appearance of business efficiency, yet it actually was a serious menace to efficiency and vital leadership in the work of God. Through the nineties these tendencies developed rapidly, but in God's own time and in his own way they were checked."},{"refcode_short":"6T 6.2","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 6.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"It was in these times and under the influence of the spirit of prophecy counsels that the ground structure was laid for organizational changes in the administration of the denomination's world work. As the cause was pioneered and developed rapidly under the favorable conditions of Australia, steps were taken to bind the local conference organizations into a “union conference,” thus establishing an organizational unit between the local conference and the General Conference. This made possible, on-the-ground planning by the group of workers close to the problems, and thus relieved the General Conference of many minor details. The result was encouraging and formed the pattern which was soon to be followed throughout the denomination."},{"refcode_short":"6T 6.3","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 6.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In the lines of medical evangelism a beginning was made in Australia during this period, but in the United States it was a time of great expansion. A medical college was set in operation which attracted an increasing number of Seventh-day Adventist youth desiring preparation as medical missionaries. New branch institutions were opened, receiving their guidance, finance, and personnel from the great parent institution at Battle Creek. A large work was also launched for the fallen and unfortunate. But good enterprises are often threatened with the danger of overemphasis, thereby bringing an unbalance into the work of God as a whole. So now it seemed that the medical missionary work, which had been designated as the right arm of the message, threatened to become the body."},{"refcode_short":"6T 7.1","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 7.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Too, while there was great advance in the development of medical missionaries and medical missionary work in connection with the Battle Creek Sanitarium, there was growing indifference on the part of some Seventh-day Adventists to the basic principles of healthful living. These conditions help us to understand the significance of the repeated appeals in volume 6 calling the people to higher standards of living, urging a united medical and evangelistic ministry, delineating our duty to orphans and the aged of the household of faith, and cautioning against an unbalanced work."},{"refcode_short":"6T 7.2","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 7.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"As the denominational work developed in many fields, literature found an ever increasingly important place. Colporteur evangelists constituted an army, with the individual colporteur a part of the recognized staff of gospel heralds in each section of the world field. In not a few instances these literature evangelists had formed the spearhead of attack in carrying the message to new and distant lands. Volume 6 sets forth the dignity and importance of the colporteur ministry."},{"refcode_short":"6T 7.3","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 7.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"This eleven-year period between the publication of volumes 5 and 6 of the Testimonies marked the issuance of several important E. G. White books. In 1890 Patriarchs and Prophets came from the press. Steps to Christ was published in 1892, and what is today known as “the old edition” of Gospel Workers Was also printed that year. Christian Education, the forerunner of Education, was issued in 1894, and two years later Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing and Christ Our Saviour were printed. Work on the manuscript for The Desire of Ages was completed and the book printed in 1898, and in 1900 Christ's Object Lessons was published."},{"refcode_short":"6T 8.1","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 8.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"In an effort to relieve our institutions of the heavy indebtedness which they were carrying, Mrs. White donated the manuscript for Christ's Object Lessons and urged our church members and workers to join in its wide sale to their neighbors and friends. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were thus brought into the cause through this relief book campaign, and thousands of copies of this truth-filled book were distributed."},{"refcode_short":"6T 8.2","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 8.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"A type of work was in this way initiated which led large numbers of lay members to call from house to house in behalf of the work of the church. Thus the way was paved for the “ingathering” campaigns which were to develop a few years later into a source of revenue to the work of God, yielding millions of dollars."},{"refcode_short":"6T 8.3","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 8.3 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Of course, all through this eleven-year period, scores and hundreds of communications bearing warnings, counsels, and encouragement were penned by the messenger of the Lord and were sent into the field in letters and in articles in the journals of the denomination. While many of these dealt with subjects already presented less comprehensively in the earlier Testimonies, some new phases of counsel were set forth and former counsels emphasized. These are found in such general sections as “Cautions and Counsels” and “Calls to Service.” among the important articles comprising these sections are such as deal with “The Observance of the Sabbath,” “A Revival in Health Reform,” “Our Attitude toward the Civil Authorities,” “Preparation for the Final Crisis,” and “The Relief of Our Schools.” The adding of this new volume to the growing series of Testimonies for the Church deeply impressed Seventh-day Adventists with the direct way in which God was continuing to guide and lead his people."},{"refcode_short":"6T 9","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 9 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Section 1—The Outlook"},{"refcode_short":"6T 9","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 9 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Chapter 1—God's Purpose in the Church"},{"refcode_short":"6T 9.1","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 9.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"It is God's purpose to manifest through His people the principles of His kingdom.

At the burning bush Moses received from God the message for the king of Egypt: “Let My people go, that they may serve Me.” Exodus 7:16.

From Egypt He led them to Mount Sinai, where He revealed to them His glory. Here was nothing to attract their senses or divert their minds from God; and as the vast multitude looked at the lofty mountains towering above them, they could realize their own nothingness in the sight of God. Beside these rocks, immovable except by the power of the divine will, God communicated with men. And that His word might ever be clear and distinct in their minds, He proclaimed amid thunder and lightning and with terrible majesty the law which He had given in Eden and which was the transcript of His character. And the words were written on tables of stone by the finger of God. Thus the will of the infinite God was revealed to a people who were called to make known to every nation, kindred, and tongue the principles of His government in heaven and in earth."},{"refcode_short":"6T 10.1","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 10.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"To the same work He has called His people in this generation. To them He has revealed His will, and of them He requires obedience. In the last days of this earth's history the voice that spoke from Sinai is still saying to men: “Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.” Exodus 20:3. Man has set his will against the will of God, but he cannot silence this word of command. The human mind can never fully comprehend its obligation to the higher power, but it cannot evade the obligation. Profound theories and speculations may abound, men may try to set science in opposition to revelation, and thus do away with the law of God; but stronger and still stronger will the Holy Spirit bring before them the command: “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.” Matthew 4:10."},{"refcode_short":"6T 10.2","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 10.2 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"How is the world treating the law of God?

In their desire to evade the cross bearing attendant on obedience, even the churches are taking sides with the great apostate in claiming that the law of God has been changed or abrogated.

In Zechariah's vision the two olive trees which stand before God are represented as emptying the golden oil out of themselves through golden tubes into the bowl of the sanctuary. From this the lamps of the sanctuary are fed, that they may give a continuous bright and shining light. So from the anointed ones that stand in God's presence the fullness of divine light and love and power is imparted to His people, that they may impart to others light and joy and refreshing.

By beholding the goodness, the mercy, the justice, and the love of God revealed in the church, the world is to have a representation of His character. And when the law of God is thus exemplified in the life, even the world will recognize the superiority of those who love and fear and serve God above every other people on the earth. The Lord has His eye upon every one of His people; He has His plans concerning each. It is His purpose that those who practice His holy precepts shall be a distinguished people. To the people of God today as well as to ancient Israel belong the words written by Moses through the Spirit of Inspiration: “Thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto Himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.” Deuteronomy 7:6.“Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the Lord my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it. Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people. For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon Him for?

They had upon their foreheads the seal of the living God, and he said: “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.

Instead of having mammoth camp meetings in a few localities, more good would be done by having smaller meetings in many places. Thus the work will be constantly extending into new fields. Just as soon as the standard of truth is lifted in one locality, and it is safe to leave the new converts, we must plan to enter other new fields. Our camp meetings are a power, and when held in a place where the community can be stirred, they will have far greater power than when for the convenience of our own people they are located where, because of previous meetings and the rejection of truth, the public interest is deadened."},{"refcode_short":"6T 34.1","refcode_long":"Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 34.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"A mistake has been made in holding camp meetings in out-of-the-way places and in continuing in the same place year after year.

The average daily attendance from the outside was between eighty and one hundred, and on Sundays there was a larger number present. Most of the children were very regular in their attendance. The same spirit of earnestness, attention, and order that characterized the services among the older ones marked the children's meetings.

The work of beneficence enjoined in this chapter is the work that God requires His people to do at this time. It is a work of His own appointment. We are not left in doubt as to where the message applies, and the time of its marked fulfillment, for we read: “They that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.” Verse 12. God's memorial, the seventh-day Sabbath, the sign of His work in creating the world, has been displaced by the man of sin. God's people have a special work to do in repairing the breach that has been made in His law; and the nearer we approach the end, the more urgent this work becomes. All who love God will show that they bear His sign by keeping His commandments. They are the restorers of paths to dwell in. The Lord says: “If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, ... then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth.” Verses 13, 14. Thus genuine medical missionary work is bound up inseparably with the keeping of God's commandments, of which the Sabbath is especially mentioned, since it is the great memorial of God's creative work. Its observance is bound up with the work of restoring the moral image of God in man. This is the ministry which God's people are to carry forward at this time.

Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?” Verses 6, 7.

God will bless men and women as they with willing hearts share their homes with these homeless ones.

They have not provided nourishing food to take the place of injurious articles; and they have not considered that tact and ingenuity must be exercised in preparing food in the most healthful manner. The system must be properly nourished in order to perform its work.

Then, as we make God's word the guide of our lives, for us is answered the prayer of Christ: “Sanctify them through Thy truth: Thy word is truth.” John 17:17.

The same agencies are at our command, with facilities multiplied a hundredfold.

In tithes and offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed Me, even this whole nation. Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in Mine house, and prove Me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts.

All that men enjoy, they receive from the Lord's great firm, and He is pleased to have His heritage enjoy His goods; but all who stand under the bloodstained banner of Prince Immanuel are to acknowledge their dependence upon God and their accountability to Him by returning to the treasury a certain portion as His own.

In this work, which devolves upon every church member, is the life and growth of the church. He whose life consists in ever receiving and never giving, soon loses the blessing.

The self-sacrificing efforts put forth by the members of our churches will prove a means of uniting them, that they may be sanctified, body, soul, and spirit, as vessels unto honor, prepared to receive the Holy Spirit. Those who seek to do God's will, investing every talent to the best advantage, will become wise in working for His kingdom.

The Lord does not force any to engage in His work; but to those who place themselves decidedly on His side, He will give a willing mind. He will bless all who work out the spirit which He works in. To such workers He will give favor and success. As field after field is entered, new methods and new plans will spring from new circumstances. New thoughts will come with the new workers who give themselves to the work. As they seek the Lord for help, He will communicate with them. They will receive plans devised by the Lord Himself. Souls will be converted, and money will come in. The workers will find waste places of the Lord's vineyard lying close beside fields that have been worked. Every field shows new places to win.

New, rich thoughts come to him. Light is given to the intellect, determination to the will, sensitiveness to the conscience, purity to the imagination. The heart becomes more tender, the thoughts more spiritual, the service more Christlike.

And as long as probation continues, there will be opportunity for the canvasser to work. When the religious denominations unite with the papacy to oppress God's people, places where there is religious freedom will be opened by evangelistic canvassing. If in one place the persecution becomes severe, let the workers do as Christ has directed. “When they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another.” If persecution comes there, go to still another place. God will lead His people, making them a blessing in many places. Were it not for persecution they would not be so widely scattered abroad to proclaim the truth. And Christ declares: “Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.” Matthew 10:23.
