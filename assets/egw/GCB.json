Then Christ could not have been placed in Adam's position, to go over the ground where Adam stumbled and fell; he could not have gained the victory that Adam failed to gain. Unless he was placed in a position as trying as that in which Adam stood, he could not redeem Adam's failure.

Every earthly and selfish interest will be swallowed up in the longing to rescue these souls.

They asked, “Wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?” The Lord rebuked their curiosity, and said, “It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.” There was one thing that they might understand, and that was that they were to receive power after that the Holy Ghost should come upon them, and that they were to be witnesses of Christ. All this itching curiosity to know the set time, is rebuked. This has not been given to man to know, and we are not to feel anxious about these things which the Lord has never committed to us, but has kept in his own possession, unrevealed.

The [eternal] principles of truth should be extolled. The holy and paternal character of God should be presented to men. Our obligation in our daily actions should be laid bare, that we may understand our relation to God and to each other; for we are to watch for souls as they who must give an account. We must present to the people, not the imaginations of men, not their schemes and conclusions but the grace of God in the gift of his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.

And what rich experiences the teacher obtains in educating those in the darkness of error! He is a learner, and sees wonderful things in the word of God. Ever and ever, as he attempts to explain the Scriptures, the Holy Spirit is working with his own mind and in his own heart.

With Christ he gave all heaven, that the moral image of God might be restored in man. Our part is to appreciate the means provided, and in harmony with the divine mind work out our salvation.

In him divinity and humanity were combined. Upon his mediatorial work hangs the hope of the perishing world. No one but Christ has ever succeeded in living a perfect life, in living a pure, spotless character.

There is danger that original devisings and superstitious imaginings will take the place of the Scriptures. Tell our people, Be not anxious to bring in something not revealed in the Word. Keep close to Christ. Remember his words: ‘Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you; and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.’ He is with us as we teach the words he spoke in the Old Testament as well as in the New. He who gave commandment in the New Testament is the one also who gave the instruction contained in the Old Testament. The Old and New Testaments are both sacred; for they both contain the words of Christ. All communication from heaven to earth since Adam's fall has come through Christ. He who believes the instruction contained in the New Testament and in the Old, doing those things which Christ has commanded therein, has the Saviour always with him.”"},{"refcode_short":"GCB July 1,  1900, par. 4","refcode_long":"The General Conference Bulletin July 1,  1900, paragraph 4","content":"“The apostles and prophets and holy men of old did not perfect their characters by miracles, by some wonderful and unusual demonstration; but they used the ability given them by God, trusting alone in the righteousness of Christ.

With his long human arm he encircles the race, while with his divine arm he grasps the throne of the infinite. Thus finite man is united with the infinite God.

Christ was an overcomer. He met the devil with, “It is written.” He entered into no argument. When Satan tempted him to make the stones bread, he said, “It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” Then Christ was tempted in regard to ambition. Satan placed him upon a pinnacle of the temple, saying, “Cast thyself down.” He could tell what was written. “It is written,” he said, “He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.” But Satan did not tell the whole. He left out the words, “To keep thee in all thy ways.” There was a way in which Christ was to do his work, but not in a presumptuous manner. He was to be an example to humanity.

What did he say?—“It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.... Get thee hence.” Satan could not stand after the “Get thee hence” had come.

It is at his coming that Christ is to “change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body.” Philippians 3:21. When Christ shall come with a great sound of a trumpet, and shall call the dead from their prison house, then the saints will receive holy flesh. Then this mortal shall put on immortality, and this corruptible shall put on incorruption. Then Christ will be admired in all them that believe. He will see of the travail of his soul, and will be satisfied. Then will break forth from immortal beings the song of triumph, “Worthy, worthy is the Lamb.”"},{"refcode_short":"GCB April 23,  1901, Art.

They are then prepared to do a good and successful work. Teachers must not exhibit a censorious spirit. The faults of a student must not be exposed before the whole school.

Let the faults of students be dealt with privately, lest the soul is hurt beyond remedy. Let teachers do all in their power to gain the confidence and love of their students. Then they can do with them what they please. Let teachers conduct themselves in accordance with the example of the great Teacher.

Is it not surprising that the Lord continues to bestow his love and favor upon those who are so undeserving? Let those who are supposed to be yoked up with Christ deal with human minds according to his methods of government. Let them cultivate meekness and lowliness of heart. Mildness is not weakness.

If they had received the message from the heavenly courts they would have united with Christ in changing this order. This acceptance of the truth of heavenly origin, the transformation of their methods, would have brought all nations under the banner of Jesus Christ. But this was not to be. The great men of the Jewish nation had no sympathy with Christ. They had no disposition to make changes. They stood opposed to gospel reform.

The prophet was in Dothan, and thither the King of Syria sent horses and chariots and a great host, to take him. “And when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do? And he answered, Fear not; for they that are with us are more than they that be with them.

And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?

The very worst thing that could now be done would be for the Review and Herald Office to be once more built up in Battle Creek. The way has been opened for it to break up its association there,—association with worldly men, which ought to be broken. Unjustifiable commercial business has been carried on, because the money that it brought in was needed. I saw One of undisputed authority go into the office and look over the accounts, with the leading men, noting how much had been taken in for the publication of matter that should never have seen the light of day. He asked, “How much do you gain on this work?” When the answer was given, He said, “The outlay necessary to do this work is larger than you estimate; but were your estimate correct, the loss in spirituality far out-weighs the estimated gain.” Pernicious matter has been published right in our office, and if some part of the work had to be delayed, it was the work on the books containing the light of truth. This was greatly displeasing to the Lord. The apprentices were being educated in the false doctrines contained in the matter brought in. And the Review and Herald presses were sending these false doctrines out to the world."},{"refcode_short":"GCB April 6,  1903, Art.

The Lord is not very well pleased with Battle Creek. Not all that has been done in Battle Creek is well pleasing to Him.

God wants His institutions to stand in fellowship with one another, just as brethren in the church should stand in fellowship.

For a long time there were men connected with the institution whose work it was to hold Bible-readings with the patients, as the way opened Dr. Kellogg fully accorded with this. After the meeting at Minneapolis, Dr. Kellogg was a converted man, and we all knew it. We could see the converting power of God working in his heart and life. But as the institution has grown in popularity, there has been danger that the reason for which it was established would be lost sight of. Repeatedly I have given the instruction that was given to me,—that this institution should not be conducted after the manner in which worldly medical institutions are conducted; that pleasure-loving, card-playing, and theatrical performances should find no place in it.

Such an experience of constantly abiding in Christ would result in souls being brought to a knowledge of the truth. Let the petition come up before God, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do today?

Let not such conditions exist as we found in some places when we returned to America, in which individual church members, instead of realizing their responsibility, looked to men for guidance, and men to whom had been committed sacred and holy trusts in the carrying forward of the work, failed of understanding the value of personal responsibility and took upon themselves the work of ordering and dictating what their brethren should do or should not do. These are things that God will not allow in his work. He will put his burdens upon his burden-bearers. Every individual soul has a responsibility before God, and is not to be arbitrarily instructed by men as to what he shall do, what he shall say, and where he shall go.

We have a great and important work to do and God would have us take hold of that work intelligently. The placing of men in positions of responsibility in the various conferences, does not make them gods. No one has sufficient wisdom to act without counsel. Men need to consult with their brethren, to counsel together, to pray together, and to plan together for the advancement of the work. Let laborers kneel down together and pray to God, asking him to direct their course. There has been a great lack with us on this point. We have trusted too much to men's devisings.

Tell them that God would have them educated and trained to be laborers together with him. When you act your part, you can trust the Lord to act his part. Be strong in faith, and teach your children that we are all dependent upon God. Read to them the story of the four Hebrew children, and impress their minds with a realization of the influence for good that was exerted in Daniel's time because of strict adherence to principle."},{"refcode_short":"GCB May 30,  1909, par. 20","refcode_long":"The General Conference Bulletin May 30,  1909, paragraph 20","content":"In connection with your home, have a garden if possible, where your children can work and where you can work with them.

You know the strength of these appeals, and also that Elder Loughborough and my mother and father and others put their whole heart into the work of establishing that institution. As it grew, demands came from the patients for more room and better accommodations. Then, without fully counting the cost, men began a new building. It was a good plan, and would have been a very good building if completed; but when it was partially completed, there came one of those crises which sometimes manifest themselves in our work. The work of building stopped.

The most valuable thing of all in an institution of this character is the good will and confidence of the people. Let us hold on to the good will of the people. And if, because of lack of men to furnish strong management and efficient workers, we have to close some of them for a time, let us wait patiently until God gives us the men to open them again.

He has given dreams and visions, symbols and figures, and those to whom the truth was thus revealed have themselves embodied the thought in human language. The ten commandments were spoken by God himself, and were written by his own hand. They are of divine, and not human, composition. But the Bible, with its God-given truths, expressed in the language of men, presents a union of the divine and the human. Such a union existed in the nature of Christ, who was the Son of God and the Son of man. Thus it is true of the Bible, as it was of Christ, that ‘the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.’ Written in different ages, by men who differed widely in rank and occupation, and in mental and spiritual endowments, the books of the Bible present a wide contrast in style, as well as a diversity in the nature of the subjects unfolded. Different forms of expression are employed by different writers; often the same truth is more strikingly presented by one than by another.

She gives general instruction, “Find what I have written on such and such subjects, and offer it to the Review.” Or, “Find what I have written on such and such subjects, and offer it to the Signs of The Times.” And so, as her strength is less, she depends more than formerly upon her workers to make the selection of material."},{"refcode_short":"GCB June 2,  1913, par. 47","refcode_long":"The General Conference Bulletin June 2,  1913, paragraph 47","content":"Sometimes the editors of our papers feel the need of articles on certain subjects, and they write to us, “May we feel free to reprint what appeared in the Review (or Signs of the Times) years ago?” We usually reply, “Yes; use your judgment.” At other times they tell us what they think is the need of the people, and we search in the manuscript files and find some precious document that contains the very warning and counsel that it is felt the people need. This is prepared for publication in article form, and sent forward. Thus there is a harmony of plan and a hearty cooperation in the work, and we who are helpers in this work find that it is a blessed privilege to have a part in it."},{"refcode_short":"GCB June 6,  1913, par. 47","refcode_long":"The General Conference Bulletin June 6,  1913, paragraph 47","content":"June 6, 1913"},{"refcode_short":"GCB June 6,  1913","refcode_long":"The General Conference Bulletin June 6,  1913","content":"Communication From Mrs. E. G. White"},{"refcode_short":"GCB June 6,  1913, par. 1","refcode_long":"The General Conference Bulletin June 6,  1913, paragraph 1","content":"Last night I seemed to be in earnest conversation with some of our brethren who seemed to be unable to take a broad view of the work that God desired them to do. Some in their efforts were going beyond that which was wise and prudent, while others were falling short of that which was required of them. I was trying to make these brethren understand the necessity of carrying the work forward intelligently, so that one worker would not tear down the work that another was endeavoring to build up."},{"refcode_short":"GCB June 6,  1913, par. 2","refcode_long":"The General Conference Bulletin June 6,  1913, paragraph 2","content":"This morning after dressing, I began to look over a collection of manuscripts that lay on my office table. The first on which my eye fell was one in which were laid down principles that lie at the foundation of all successful efforts for souls,—principles that every worker needs prayerfully and carefully to study. Again and again I have been impressed to write that which, if studied under the direction of the Holy Spirit would enable our brethren to take right views of their privileges and responsibilities. But unless these principles are so studied, they cannot be worked out in the experience. Unless there is a united drawing with God, unless those in positions of leadership lift up their hearts to heaven, confessing their defects of character, and pleading for help to reach a higher standard, they will not discern their own spiritual needs, or strive successfully for higher attainments."},{"refcode_short":"GCB June 6,  1913, par. 3","refcode_long":"The General Conference Bulletin June 6,  1913, paragraph 3","content":"Because a worker does not see the importance of a fellow worker's efforts, he should not pull back and make the work go hard. Every laborer should now be working with zeal and energy, pressing onward and upward. There should be no such thing as backsliding from the light that has guided us for so many years. God is calling upon his people to reach a higher standard of spirituality, to work unitedly. Much of the work being accomplished in the cause of present truth would require not more than half the labor that it now demands if the workers would come unitedly to the help of the Lord, lending their courage and zeal, their faith and influence, to the building up of whatever enterprise is called for."},{"refcode_short":"GCB June 6,  1913, par. 4","refcode_long":"The General Conference Bulletin June 6,  1913, paragraph 4","content":"A sad mistake is made when workers take up some work that God has not set them, and carry it forward as if that were the plan of the Lord. The result is disappointment; and when the realization comes that they have been in error, it is often the case that the workers fall into discouragement, and go off on a line that leads directly away from the reformations that God desires to see wrought."},{"refcode_short":"GCB June 6,  1913, par. 5","refcode_long":"The General Conference Bulletin June 6,  1913, paragraph 5","content":"There is a great work to be done, and we do not half realize its sacredness, or appreciate its uplifting influence on the lives that are yielded to its fashioning. We are to learn to take God at his word, for thus only can we carry out his purposes. There should be no holding back on the part of any. With all the light that has been given us, we cannot truthfully say. “We did not understand his will.” Let there be a drawing together, every one lifting in spiritual lines. Let us manifest a godlike earnestness of purpose instead of taking an attitude of careless indifference. The indifference manifested by some discourages those who are trying to do faithful work."},{"refcode_short":"GCB June 6,  1913, par. 6","refcode_long":"The General Conference Bulletin June 6,  1913, paragraph 6","content":"Not all are pursuing a course of indifference. There are some who are reviewing their past mistakes, and are learning from these mistakes the lessons that God would teach them. They are making close examination of self. These workers are studying their own lives in the light of Christ's perfect example, and are becoming changed into the same image."},{"refcode_short":"GCB June 6,  1913, par. 7","refcode_long":"The General Conference Bulletin June 6,  1913, paragraph 7","content":"Our ministers have some experiences to gain that have not yet been gained, standards to reach higher than those yet attained. They have lessons to learn of personal ministry for souls. There is a special work to be done for the newly converted. Do not think when these have embraced the doctrines of the message, that you can leave them there. Many have thus been left in spiritual darkness; they know not how to go forward. Go to these souls; pray with them; lift them up. Do not rest until you see that they are striving to reach the standard that God's Word sets for his children."},{"refcode_short":"GCB June 6,  1913, par. 8","refcode_long":"The General Conference Bulletin June 6,  1913, paragraph 8","content":"We talk much about the truth; but unless we live the truth, unless we ourselves are reaching its standard, and helping others to reach it, our work will not have the approval of Heaven."},{"refcode_short":"GCB June 6,  1913, par. 9","refcode_long":"The General Conference Bulletin June 6,  1913, paragraph 9","content":"We do not realize how untiring are Satan's efforts to sap our spirituality. He is working mightily that the people of God may be only half converted. Then self will swell to large proportions, and there will be no revelation to the world of the transforming power of God. If this power does not rest upon God's people and move them to sanctified action, they cannot do the work in the earth that has been shown us must be done. Without this power, they will not realize their responsibility as his representatives in a world of unbelief."}]
