This edition contains two additional chapters, “God in Nature” and “The Spirit Filled Life,” and also an appendix of parallel scripture references, which will be found exceedingly helpful in making clear to the mind of the reader the fact that the principles presented in this work are not mere human inventions, but are a part of the divine order appointed for the human family at the beginning, and which is to be restored when all things shall be made new. It may be added that the compiler has carefully revised the entire work, making slight emendations and additions here and there in nearly every chapter, but, as before, without change in the original text from which the compilation has been made."},{"refcode_short":"HL 9","refcode_long":"Healthful Living, p. 9 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"Chapter 1—Our Bodies, Temples of the Holy Ghost"},{"refcode_short":"HL 9","refcode_long":"Healthful Living, p. 9 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"God's Workmanship"},{"refcode_short":"HL 9.1","refcode_long":"Healthful Living, p. 9.1 (Ellen Gould White)","content":"1.

Mothers have thought it necessary to compress the bodies of their infant children to keep them in shape, as if fearful that without tight bandages they would fall in pieces or become deformed. Do the animal creation become deformed because nature is left to do her own work? Do the little lambs become deformed because they are not girded about with bands to give them shape? They are delicately and beautifully formed. Human infants are the most perfect, and yet the most helpless, of all the Creator's handiwork, and therefore their mothers should be instructed in regard to physical laws, so as to be capable of rearing them with physical, mental, and moral health. Mothers, nature has given our infants forms which need no girts or bands to perfect them.

The dress of the infant should be so arranged that its body will not be in the least compressed after taking a full meal....

If, in praying for healing, they refuse to use the simple remedies provided by God to alleviate pain and to aid nature in her work, lest it be a denial of faith, they are talking an unwise position. It is not a denial of faith, it is in strict harmony with the plans of God....

There is danger in the first and slightest departure from the strictest veracity. In your work, be true to yourself. Preserve your God-given dignity in the fear of God.

Nature could convey her lessons to man in his innocence; but sin and transgression brought a blight upon nature, and intervened between nature and nature's God. Had man never disobeyed his Creator, had he remained in his state of perfect rectitude, he could have understood and known God. But when man disobeyed God, he gave evidence that he believed the words of an apostate rather than the words of God. He was told by the enemy to eat of the tree of knowledge.

Men of the greatest intellect cannot understand the mysteries of Jehovah as revealed in nature. Divine inspiration asks many questions which the most profound scholar cannot answer. These questions were not asked supposing that we could answer them, but to call our attention to the deep mysteries of God, and to make men know that their wisdom is limited, that in the common things of daily life there are mysteries past the comprehension of finite minds; that the judgment and purposes of God are past finding out, his wisdom unsearchable. If he reveals himself to man, it is by shrouding himself in the thick cloud of mystery. God's purpose is to conceal more of himself than he makes known to men. Could men fully understand the ways and works of God, they would not then believe him to be the infinite one. He is not to be comprehended by man in his wisdom, and reasons, and purposes. “His ways are past finding out.” His love can never be explained upon natural principles. If this could be done, we would not feel that we could trust him with the interests of our souls. Skeptics refuse to believe because with their finite minds they cannot comprehend the infinite power by which God reveals himself to men. Even the mechanism of the human body cannot be fully understood; it presents mysteries that baffle the most intelligent. Yet because human science cannot in its research explain the ways and works of the Creator, men will doubt the existence of God, and ascribe infinite power to nature. God's existence, his character, his law, are facts that all the reasoning of men of the highest attainments cannot controvert. They deny the claims of God and neglect the interests of their souls, because they cannot understand his ways and works. Yet God is ever seeking to instruct finite men, that they may exercise faith in him, and trust themselves wholly in his hands.
