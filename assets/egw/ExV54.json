There is no difference made between the most holy apostles and the vilest infidel. They are both made to teach the same thing. It matters not who satan makes to speak, if his object is only accomplished. He was so intimately connected with Paine upon earth, and aided him, that it is an easy thing for him to know the very words he used, and the very hand-writing of one of his devoted children who served him so faithfully, and accomplished his purposes so well. Satan dictated much of his writings, and it is an easy thing for him to dictate sentiments through his angels now, and make it appear that it comes through Thomas Paine, who was his devoted servant while he lived.

He is, through his power and lying wonders, tearing away the foundation of the Christian's hope, and putting out their sun that is to lighten them in the narrow way to heaven.

It related mostly to the brethren in that place. “I saw that the brethren commenced to sacrifice their property, and handed it out without having the true object set before them—the suffering cause—and they handed out too freely, too much and too often. I saw that the teachers should have stood in a place to correct this error, and exert a good influence in the church. Money was made to be of little or no consequence; the sooner disposed of, the better. A bad example has been set by some in accepting large donations, and not giving the least caution to those who had means not to use it too freely and carelessly. And by accepting so large an amount of means, without questioning whether God had made it their duty to bestow so largely, they sanctioned the brethren's giving too bountifully."},{"refcode_short":"ExV54 11.2","refcode_long":"Supplement to the Christian Experience and Views of Ellen G.

Those who had means were thrown into great perplexity. One brother was much hurt by too much means being put into his hands. He did not study economy; but lived extravagantly, and in his travels laid out money here and there to no profit. He spread a wrong influence by making such free use of the Lord's money, and would say to others, and in his own heart, There is means enough in Jackson, more than can be used before the Lord comes. Some were very much injured by such a course, and came into the truth with wrong views, not realizing that it was the Lord's money they were using, and not feeling the worth of it. And I saw that these poor souls who have just embraced the third angel's message, and have had such an example set before them, will have much to learn, to deny self, and suffer for Christ's sake. They will have to learn to give up their ease, and cease studying their convenience and comfort, and bear in mind the worth of souls. Those who feel the “woe” upon them will not be for making great preparations and fixings outwardly, to travel in ease and comfort. Those who have no calling have been encouraged into the field. Others have been affected by these things, and have not felt the need of economy, of denying themselves, and putting into the treasury of the Lord.

It is a sin to support and indulge in idleness, those who are able to labor.

And now in these last days, while God is bringing his children into the unity of the faith, there is more real need of order than ever before. For as God is uniting his children, Satan and his evil angels are very busy to prevent this unity, and to destroy it. Therefore men will be hurried into the field; men without wisdom, lacking judgment, perhaps not ruling well their own house, and not having order or government over the very few that God has given them charge of at home; yet they feel capable of having charge of the flock. They make many wrong moves, and all the messengers are thought, by those unacquainted with our faith, to be like these self-sent men; and the cause of God is reproached, and the truth shunned by many unbelievers, who would otherwise be candid, and anxious to inquire, Are these things so?"},{"refcode_short":"ExV54 15.2","refcode_long":"Supplement to the Christian Experience and Views of Ellen G.

Others have not the argument; but because a few brethren hear them pray well, and give an exciting exhortation now and then, press them into the field, to engage in a work that God has not qualified them for, and when they have not sufficient experience and judgment for the work. Spiritual pride comes in, and they are lifted up, and act under the deception of thinking that they are laborers. They do not know themselves. They lack sound judgment and patient reasoning.

I saw that it was not a positive evidence that men are called of God, because they have some success; for now the angels of God are moving upon the hearts of his honest children to enlighten their understanding as to the present truth, that they may lay hold upon it and live. And even if self-sent men put themselves where God does not put them, and profess to be teachers, and souls receive the truth by hearing them talk it, this is no evidence that they are called of God. The souls who receive the truth from them, receive it to be brought into trial and bondage, as they afterwards find that these men were not standing in the counsel of God. Even if wicked men talk the truth, some may receive it; but it does not bring those who talked it, into any more favor with God. Wicked men are wicked men still.

I saw that they were in danger in the apostles’ days of being imposed upon and deceived by false teachers; and men were chosen by the brethren, or church, who had given good evidence that they were capable of ruling well their own house, and preserving order in their own families; men that could enlighten those who were in darkness. Inquiry was made of God concerning them, and then, according to the mind of the church, and the Holy Ghost, they were set apart by the laying on of hands. Having received their commission from God, and having the approbation of the church, they go forth baptizing in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and to administer the ordinances of the Lord's house, often waiting upon the saints by presenting them the emblems of the broken body and spilt blood of the crucified Saviour, to keep fresh in the memory of God's beloved children, his sufferings and death."},{"refcode_short":"ExV54 19.1","refcode_long":"Supplement to the Christian Experience and Views of Ellen G.
